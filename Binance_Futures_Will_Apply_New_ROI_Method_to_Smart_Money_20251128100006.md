Fellow Binancians,

Binance Futures will update the ROI (Return on Investment) calculation method for Smart Money, which will be applicable to all traders, effective from 2025-12-04 08:00 (UTC). 

Key Changes

The new ROI calculation method introduces a new concept of “Maxbasebalance” to replace accumulated deposits, providing a more accurate reflection of a trader’s performance.

New ROI calculation method: = [Profit and Loss / Maxbasebalance]

Basebalance = Initial deposit + net deposit

From 2025-12-04 08:00 (UTC), the system updates the BaseBalance each time a deposit or withdrawal is completed. Whenever a new MaxBaseBalance is reached, the system will update the ROI accordingly.
