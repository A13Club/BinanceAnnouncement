Campaign Points Calculation

Your total Campaign Points will be calculated based on the number of tasks you complete during the Promotion Period.

Total Campaign Points = Sum of (Task Points × Promotion Period Multiplier*)

Notes: 

USD values are calculated based on the closing price on the day of subscription, at 23:59 (UTC). Each task is counted independantly.  *Promotion Period Multiplier: A multiplier based on the number of days till the last day of Promotion when the subscription happens. The Promotion lasts for 14 days from 2025-12-26 00:00 (UTC) to 2026-01-08 23:59 (UTC). Longer subscription periods will have higher multipliers. If a position is redeemed early, it may be counted as 0 points for that task. The maturity of a position is not considered a redemption.Selling DOLO on Binance Spot or Binance Convert during the Promotion Period will cause your task points to be deducted.For Dual Investment, Discount Buy, and Locked Products, if the subscription period is less than 14 days, the Promotion Period Multiplier will be calculated based on the lesser of the subscription duration or the Promotion Period Multiplier. If the subscription period exceeds 14 days, the campaign Promotion Period Multiplier will be applied.
