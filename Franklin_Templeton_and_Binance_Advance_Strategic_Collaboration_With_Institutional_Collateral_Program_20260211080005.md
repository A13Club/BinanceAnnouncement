# Franklin Templeton and Binance Advance Strategic Collaboration With Institutional Collateral Program

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region. 

Fellow Binancians,

Binance and Franklin Templeton began collaborating in September 2025 to develop new digital asset initiatives and products. 

Today, we are proud to announce the first offering under this strategic partnership: an institutional off-exchange collateral program supported by the custody and settlement infrastructure provided by Ceffu, Binance’s institutional crypto-native custody partner.

Eligible clients can now use tokenized money market fund (MMF) shares issued via Franklin Templeton’s Benji Technology Platform as off-exchange collateral when trading on Binance.

Key Features of the Institutional Off-Exchange Collateral Program

The program alleviates a long-standing pain point for institutional traders by allowing them to use traditional, regulated, yield-bearing money market fund assets in digital markets without parking those assets on an exchange. Instead, the value of Benji-issued fund shares is mirrored within Binance’s trading environment, while the tokenized assets themselves remain securely held off-exchange in third-party custody. 

This reduces counterparty risk, enabling institutional participants to earn yield and support their trading activity without moving assets on-exchange. It also reflects broader institutional trends, including rising demand for stable, yield-bearing collateral that supports 24/7 settlement cycles and integrates seamlessly with existing governance and risk frameworks.

How to Get Started

Eligible users can access Binance’s institutional off-exchange settlement services and begin trading using Benji-issued MMF shares held off-exchange. Please contact your designated account manager or complete the form below to get started.
