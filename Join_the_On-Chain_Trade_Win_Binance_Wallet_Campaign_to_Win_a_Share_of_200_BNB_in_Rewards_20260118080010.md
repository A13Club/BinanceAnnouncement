Campaign Rules:

During the campaign, participants must abide by the following rules:

Use Binance Wallet (Keyless) to register and conduct on-chain transactions. Transactions conducted via third-party DApps or non-Keyless wallets will not be counted. Once the wallet registration is confirmed, it cannot be changed during the Competition Period.The tokens traded must be on the BNB Smart Chain. Transactions on other chains will not be counted, and cross-chain transactions will not be counted.The trading pairs must include one of the following tokens: USDT, USDC, USD1, U, BNB, or WBNB. If a user uses a non-permitted token to swap for other tokens (e.g. swapping Token A for Token B), and the realized PnL of Token A is positive, then all realized PnL generated by Token A during the Competition Period will not be counted.PnL generated from trades between stablecoins, or between stablecoins and BNB, or WBNB, will not be counted.During the Competition Period, if a user conducts any on-chain actions on any token other than on-chain buying, selling, or transfer in within Binance Wallet (Keyless), and the realized PnL of that token is positive, then all realized PnL of that token will not be counted.At the start of the competition, for any token in the participant's wallet that is not among the aforementioned permitted tokens and has a value greater than $10, all realized PnL generated from that token during the competition will not be counted.

To qualify for the leaderboard, participants must meet the following criteria during the Competition Period:

Trade (buy and sell) at least one token on the BNB Smart Chain to qualify for the leaderboard. The following tokens are not counted toward the requirement of trading at least one token: USDT, USDC, USD1, U, BNB, or WBNB.Examples: User A buys and sells Token A using USDT on the BNB Smart Chain. USDT is excluded from the token count, so the example counts as trading 1 token (Token A) instead of 2 different tokens on the BNB chain. The trade will be considered eligible for the campaign.User B buys and sells BNB using USDC on the BNB Smart Chain. Both BNB and USDC do not count toward the requirement of trading at least one token. The trade will not be considered eligible for the campaign.

Realized PnL Calculation Example：

Realized PnL = (Sell Amount / Sell Quantity - Buy Amount / Buy Quantity) * Sell Quantity = (Sell Price per Token - Buy Price per Token) * Sell Quantity 

Example: Suppose a user buys 100 Token A at a price of 1 USDT each. Later, the price of Token A rises to 2 USDT, and the user decides to sell 90 tokens. 

Realized PnL = (180/90 - 90/90) * 90 = (2 - 1) * 90 = 90 USDT

* Since only 90 tokens are sold, we use the buy cost of those 90 tokens (the remaining 10 tokens are still unrealized).

Note: This formula is a simplified version for reference; the actual calculation must strictly follow the rules described above.
