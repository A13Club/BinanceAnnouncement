About Mark Price:

Mark Price methodology during the pre-market trading period

Pre-market perpetual futures contract mark price is calculated using the following formula:

Mark Price = Average of last 10 seconds trade prices, calculated every second.If there are less than 21 transaction prices in the 10 seconds interval, the average of the price index will be based on the last 20 transaction prices. 

Pre-market Standard Perpetual Transition Period

Pre-market perpetual futures contracts will be converted to standard perpetual futures contracts gradually when a stable index price can be derived from the spot market(s) (as determined by Binance). The mark price will gradually converge from pre-market trading Mark Price to the standard Mark Price calculation (Mark Price = Median (Price 1, Price 2, Contract Price)) during the transition period. The transition period duration is subject to price volatility and availability of stable index price. Trading function is not affected during the transition period. Open orders and positions will not be cancelled. 

Mark Price After the Pre-Market Trading Ends

When the pre-market perpetual futures contract ends, the Mark Price will be calculated using the following formula:Mark Price = Median (Price 1, Price 2, Contract Price)

Please refer Mark Price and Price Index in USDⓈ-Margined Futures for Price 1 and Price 2 formula. 

About Funding Rates:

There are two components to the funding rate: the interest rate and the premium. Binance uses a flat interest rate fixed at 0.03% daily by default. Due to unavailability of premium index during the pre-market trading period, the funding rate will be 0.005% per funding interval since funding interval occurs every 4 hours. Binance reserves the right to adjust the interest rate from time to time depending on market conditions.After the pre-market trading ends, the funding rate will follow the standard perpetual futures contract’s funding rate rules where the maximum and minimum funding rate could go up to +2.00% / -2.00%.
