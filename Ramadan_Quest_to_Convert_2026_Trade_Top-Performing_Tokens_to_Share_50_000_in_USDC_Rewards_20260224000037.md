Fellow Binancians,

As part of our Ramadan 2026 campaign, Binance Convert is launching Ramadan Quest to Convert, a Convert-exclusive trading quest designed to reward users who actively predict and trade top-performing tokens throughout the holy month. 

During the Promotion Period, all users who confirm their participation and convert at least 15 USDC equivalent of any token to the top-performing tokens on Binance Convert, will stand to share a total of $50,000 in USDC token voucher rewards.

The top-performing token for each day (i.e., from 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC) refers to the token that undergoes the largest percentage increase in value from 00:00 (UTC) to 23:59 (UTC). Users are encouraged to review the Markets Overview and Trading Data pages before executing any trades.
