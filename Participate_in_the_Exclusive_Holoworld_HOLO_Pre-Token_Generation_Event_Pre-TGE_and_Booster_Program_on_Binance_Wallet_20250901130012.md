This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region. Terms and conditions apply.

Fellow Binancians, 

Binance is excited to launch two exclusive events for Holoworld within the Binance Wallet:

Pre-TGE: Eligible users can subscribe to Holoworld token, HOLO, before it becomes tradable.Booster Program: Share 51,200,000 HOLO in airdrops by completing phased tasks and supporting the project during its early development phase.

Holoworld Pre-TGE 

During the Pre-TGE event, users can subscribe to the HOLO tokens, exclusively within the Binance Wallet. The subscription process follows an over-subscription model, allowing up to 3 BNB deposits per user. Token allocation is proportional to the total BNB deposited by all participants. 

After the subscription period ends, users can claim their HOLO tokens via the [Assets] tab, and the unused BNB will be automatically refunded. 

Important: As this is a Pre-TGE event, HOLO tokens claimed through this event are subject to a mandatory lock-up period and will not be immediately tradable after the campaign. Tokens will only become tradable once the project team makes a decision to enable circulation. Users should ensure they are informed about and comfortable with this lock-up period before participating. Please see these FAQs for more information.
