How to Use BMT Trial Fund Vouchers:

Simple Earn Trial Fund Vouchers allow users to experience how Simple Earn Products work without using their own funds. These vouchers create a virtual position that can only be used to subscribe to Binance Simple Earn Products for trial purposes, and do not purport to provide any real monetary value. Users are entitled to receive only the APR interest rewards from these trial funds. Please refer to the FAQ for more details.

Go to Rewards Hub to check the “BMT Trial Fund Voucher”. Click “Use” on the voucher before the expiration date, which is set at 14 days upon receiving the voucher.Interest Rewards Distribution: You will start receiving the APR rewards in your Spot Account two days after the voucher is used. Check the rewards in your Earn Account.

Interest Rewards will be calculated based on the formula: Face Value * APR * (Duration / 365)For example, user A uses a 50% APR Trial Fund Voucher for 10-day Interest Rewards on 5,000 BMT. The total rewards user A can gain is: 5,000 * 50% * (10 / 365) = 68.49315068 BMT
