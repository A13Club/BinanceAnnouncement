# Binance Spot Rebalancing Bot Now Supports USDC

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance is thrilled to announce that USDC will be supported on the Spot Rebalancing Bot! Users can enjoy the same seamless rebalancing bot experience with USDC starting from 2025-10-27 08:00 (UTC). 

Previously available only with USDT, the addition of USDC marks a major step forward, particularly for our users in the European Economic Area (EEA). As a  MiCA-compliant e-money token (EMT), USDC is the first major regulated stablecoin in the EEA, enhancing trust and regulatory alignment.

All tokens with USDC trading pairs will be available on Rebalancing Bot (with the exclusion of all stablecoin pairs). Starting from 2025-10-27, newly listed tokens for USDC pairs will be enabled on the Rebalancing Bot within 1 hour of the respective tokens being listed on Binance Spot.
