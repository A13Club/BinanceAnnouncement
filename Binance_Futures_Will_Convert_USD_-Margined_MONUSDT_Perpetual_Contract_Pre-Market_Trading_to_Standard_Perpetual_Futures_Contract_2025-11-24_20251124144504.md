About Mark Price:

Pre-market Standard Perpetual Transition Period

Pre-market perpetual futures contracts will be converted to standard perpetual futures contracts gradually when a stable index price can be derived from the spot market(s) (as determined by Binance). The mark price will gradually converge from pre-market trading Mark Price to the standard Mark Price calculation (Mark Price = Median (Price 1, Price 2, Contract Price)) during the transition period. 

A ±1% of price cap will be imposed on the Mark Price where the price change is limited within ±1% range every second interval. This cap is applicable during the pre-market trading and pre-market standard perpetual transition period. 

Mark Price After the Pre-Market Trading Ends

When the pre-market perpetual futures contract ends, the Mark Price will be calculated using the following formula:Mark Price = Median (Price 1, Price 2, Contract Price)

Please refer to Mark Price and Price Index in USDⓈ-Margined Futures for Price 1 and Price 2 formulas. 

About Funding Rates:

After the pre-market trading ends, the premium index will be available, thus the funding rate will follow the standard perpetual futures contract’s funding rate rules, where the maximum and minimum funding rates could go up to +2.00% / -2.00%.
