Fellow Binancians,

From 2026-02-20 00:00 (UTC), Binance will launch an airdrop campaign rewarding all eligible users who hold World Liberty Financial USD (USD1) on our platform. Eligible users will share rewards from a grand prize pool of 235 million World Liberty Financial (WLFI) tokens. 

WLFI will be distributed as weekly rewards to USD1 holders during the Activity period. The first airdrop distribution will be on 2026-03-04, covering the reward period from 2026-02-20 00:00 (UTC) to 2026-02-27 00:00 (UTC). Subsequent rewards will be distributed every Friday thereafter.

Campaign Period: 2026-02-20 00:00 (UTC) - 2026-03-20 00:00 (UTC)

How to Participate:

Eligible users must hold USD1 in balance (net assets), in any of the following account categories on Binance:

Spot Account;Funding Account;Margin Account (USD1 as Collateral in Cross Margin, Isolated Margin or Portfolio Margin); USDⓈ-M Futures Account (USD1 as Collateral in USDⓈ-M Futures Accounts, Multi-asset mode is included).

Note: USD1 as Collaterals in Binance Futures or Margin accounts can receive a 1.2x bonus multiplier on rewards. As long as eligible users maintain at least 0.01 USD1 in their Margin or Futures Accounts, they will receive the 1.2x bonus rewards, regardless of whether they use leverage or open trades. 

USD1 acquired through borrowing the other stablecoins will receive a haircut of 70%, after accounting for liabilities from other stablecoins, including USDT, USDC, USD1, U, RLUSD, and FDUSD. 

Campaign Details:

Prize Pool: 235 million WLFI tokens will be distributed over 4 weekly installments (58.75 million WLFI tokens each week).  Distribution: Rewards will be airdropped directly to users’ Binance Spot Accounts.  Distribution Frequency: Weekly airdrops during the Campaign Period. 

Reward Distribution:

Rewards start accruing from 2026-02-20 00:00 (UTC). The first airdrop distribution will be on 2026-03-04, covering the reward period from 2026-02-20 00:00 (UTC) to 2026-02-27 00:00 (UTC). Subsequent rewards will be distributed by 18:00 (UTC) every Friday in WLFI token. Distribution records can be found in your Distribution history.

The Weekly Reward Amount will be roughly calculated as follows:

Qualifying Balance of each day = Lowest USD1 balance captured during those hourly snapshots on each day.Weekly Rewards = (7-day average of the Qualifying Balance * effective APR on the distribution day * 7) / 365 

After each weekly distribution, the effective APR for that period will be updated in this announcement. In determining the effective APR on the distribution day, Binance will take into account a number of factors, including, without limitation:

Lowest balance of the snapshots each day;The daily aggregated amount of Qualifying Balances across all eligible holders of USD1;7-day average across all eligible holders of USD1

For USD1 acquired through borrowing the other stablecoins: 

Eligible balance in Margin Account = USD1 Balance Before Leverage + Leveraged Amount * (1 - 70%): 

USD1 Balance before Leverage = MAX [USD1 Balance in Margin Account - Margin Account Liabilities of the Other Stablecoins, 0] Leveraged Amount = USD1 Balance in Margin Account - MAX [USD1 Balance in Margin Account - Margin Account Liabilities of the Other Stablecoins, 0] 

Note: ”Other Stablecoins” include USDT, USDC, USD1, U, RLUSD, FDUSD.

Case example:

User A holds 10,000 USD1 in Spot and 20,000 USD1 as collateral in Margin throughout week 1, and effective base APR is 20%, effective boosted APR is 24%, User A's rewards due to be received at the end of week 1 will be as follows:[(10,000 * 20% * 7) / 365] + [(20,000 * 24% * 7) / 365] = 130.41 USD worth of WLFIUser B borrowed 5,000 USD1 from VIP loan or Margin (“liabilities”). Among this borrowed 5,000 USD1, 4,000 USD1 was used as collateral in Margin, the remaining 1,000 USD1 was held in their Spot Account in week 1. The effective base APR is 20%, effective boosted APR is 24%, User B’s rewards due to be received at the end of week 1 will be as follows:Qualifying Balance = 0 [(0 * 20% * 7) / 365] + [(0 * 24% * 7) / 365] = 0 USD worth of WLFIUser C had 1,000 USD1 in Margin Account and used it as collateral to borrow 4,000 USDT through Margin (“Liabilities of the other Stablecoins”), then converted this 4,000 USDT to USD1. The user now holds 5,000 USD1 in Margin (“USD1 Balance”) in week 1. The effective base APR is 20%, effective boosted APR is 24%, User C’s rewards due to be received at the end of week 1 will be as follows:Qualifying Balance = MAX [5,000 - 4,000, 0] / {5,000 - MAX[5,000 - 4,000, 0] } = 1,000 + (5,000 -1,000) * (1-70%) = 2,200[(0 * 20% * 7) / 365] + [(2,200 * 24% * 7) / 365] = 10.12 USD worth of WLFI

Important Notes:

Users’ USD1 Qualifying Balance will be calculated as net assets (assets minus liabilities). USD1 as liabilities (e.g. borrowed from VIP loans, Margin loan, etc) will be excluded from the Qualifying Balance for this campaign. Snapshots of user balances and total qualifying balances will be taken at any point of time each hour to get users’ hourly balances in the above mentioned account categories. The lowest USD1 balance captured during those snapshots on each day will constitute their Qualifying Balance and be used to calculate their rewardsFor example, a user’s lowest USD1 balance captured on 2026-02-01 is zero, then their qualifying balance for that day is zero. At any snapshot time, any one of users’ supported assets must be greater than 0.01 USD1 to be included in the calculation.Users are recommended to maintain their USD1 holding throughout the Campaign Period to maximize their rewards.  Rewards distributed are rounded down to 2 decimal places. Rewards of sub-accounts will be distributed to the Spot Account of corresponding sub-accounts. Kindly note that the distribution time is not guaranteed and may change from time to time.There is no individual cap on rewards. Users’ rewards depend on their qualifying balance relative to the total qualifying balance of all eligible users and other factors. The total prize pool is 235 million WLFI tokens.Stay tuned for weekly reward distributions and updates on the Campaign.
