# Update on Binance and Pakistan Collaborate to Foster Digital Asset Growth and Regulatory Development

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region. 

Fellow Binancians,

Binance today announced a significant regulatory development in Pakistan, which followed strategic engagements between Binance’s senior leadership and Pakistani government officials. Led by Binance Co-CEO Richard Teng, these continuous discussions with key policymakers highlight Binance’s commitment to supporting the growth of a regulated and secure digital-asset ecosystem in the country.

Binance has obtained an AML registration under PVARA’s framework, marking a crucial step toward full licensing and local incorporation in Pakistan. This phased approach will enable Binance to offer AML-registered cross-border services while preparing for full Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) licensing, in alignment with Pakistan’s regulatory roadmap.

Binance remains committed to supporting digital economies across South Asia and looks forward to continuing its collaboration with regulators and stakeholders in the region to build a robust, transparent, and inclusive virtual asset ecosystem.

Please note that the changes relate to regulatory structuring and are not meant to alter the way that users interact with the platform. Users’ day-to-day use of the platform will remain substantially the same.
