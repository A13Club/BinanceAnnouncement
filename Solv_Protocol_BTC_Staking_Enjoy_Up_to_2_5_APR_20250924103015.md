Solv Protocol BTC Staking Product Rules:

Subscription Criteria: Available on a first-come, first-served basis. Minimum and maximum subscription limits and duration requirements apply, which will impact the APR rewards users receive. Refer to the respective subscription page for further details. Rewards: Solv Protocol BTC staking rewards are distributed in SOLV*. Rewards are recorded daily starting from 00:00 (UTC) after users subscribe. However, these rewards are not distributed daily. All recorded rewards will be distributed to eligible users’ Spot Accounts when the staking period ends.

Early Redemption: Users can redeem their assets anytime before maturity and the redemption process is not reversible once confirmed. Early redemptions will result in a loss of all accrued rewards. Users will receive the full balance of their locked assets in their Spot Accounts within the next 3 days.

Notes: *This is based on the token prices of BTC and SOLV at the daily snapshot time.

*Daily Rewards in SOLV = (BTC (Price in USDT) * APR / 365) / SOLV (Price in USDT)
