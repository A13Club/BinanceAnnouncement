Fellow Binancians,

Binance is excited to announce the official launch of TradFi Perpetual Contracts, expanding our product offerings to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. As part of our commitment to providing users with diverse trading choices, we are now offering perpetual futures for traditional assets.

About TradFi Perpetual Contracts:

TradFi perpetual contracts are USDT-settled contracts that track the price of underlying traditional finance (TradFi) assets, allowing users to trade on the price movements of these assets without needing to own them directly. TradFi perpetual contracts are margined and settled in the same way as existing crypto perpetuals.

The first contract, XAUUSDT (Gold), was made available to all eligible markets on 2026-01-05, and XAGUSDT (Silver), was listed on 2026-01-07. Binance will continue to expand the list of available TradFi perpetual contracts. Please note that these contracts are settled in USDT only.

How to Access TradFi Perpetuals:

You can trade TradFi perpetuals on the Binance website or App:

Binance Website: Navigate to the Binance Futures page and select the [TradFi] tab under the symbol search bar.Binance App: Go to [Futures] and tap on the symbol (e.g., BTCUSDT). Select the [TradFi] tab from the top menu to view available contracts.

Pricing and Risk Model for 24/7 Trading:

Binance TradFi perpetual contracts trade 24/7, even when underlying assets have specific market hours. To ensure fair and continuous pricing, we use robust risk management mechanisms during off-hours.

Price Index: Aggregates data from multiple vendors and updates every second during market hours. Outside these hours, it remains fixed at the last value for stability.Mark Price: Updates every second during trading hours. Outside these hours, it uses a smoothed futures price calculated with an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) to prevent sudden price swings and unnecessary liquidations.Deviation Constraints: Limits the difference between Mark Price and Price Index (e.g., ±3% for commodity contracts like XAUUSDT) to manage risk.

A New Standard in Digital Asset Regulation:

Binance is the first global crypto exchange to secure a comprehensive license under the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) framework, setting a new standard in digital asset regulation.

The TradFi Perpetual USDⓈ-Margined Futures contracts are traded on the FSRA-regulated exchange, Nest Exchange Limited, and cleared by the regulated clearing house, Nest Clearing and Custody Limited. Learn more here.
