Fellow Binancians,

Binance is committed to providing the best-in-class trading experience for users and continuously takes in community feedback to enhance its platform. Since market conditions can change significantly over time, long-pending unfilled orders placed in the past may be unexpectedly executed under extreme market conditions. Such executions can result in trades that no longer reflect users’ current trading intentions. 

Based on ongoing community feedback and to help users reduce the risk of unintended trades while improving the overall stability and efficiency of the trading environment, Binance will be canceling all pending spot and margin orders placed before 2024-01-01 00:00 (UTC) at 2026-01-21 07:00 (UTC) (the “Automatic Cancellation Event”). 

Important Notes:

This process applies only to pending unfilled historical orders before 2024-01-01 00:00 (UTC) and will not affect any completed trades.User assets remain secure with no impact on fund security, account access, or withdrawal capabilities.Users may place new orders at any time to replace any cancelled orders.Users can manually cancel any pending spot and margin orders placed before 2024-01-01 00:00 (UTC) at any time before the Automatic Cancellation Event. 

Cancellation of long-standing unfilled orders is a common practice at traditional exchanges, maintaining a healthy and efficient marketplace, and supports effective risk management. This measure is part of Binance’s routine system maintenance and risk management efforts, designed to protect users from unintended order executions during periods of high market volatility, while maintaining a stable trading environment. In this regard, users may refer to Rule 111 of Binance’s Exchange Rules.
