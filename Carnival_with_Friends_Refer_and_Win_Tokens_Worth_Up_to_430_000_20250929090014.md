Notes: 

If a user at a certain rank does not meet the minimum point threshold required for that rank, the reward for that rank will be forfeited. The user will instead receive the reward for the highest rank for which they meet the minimum point requirement, and all subsequent ranks will be adjusted accordingly.

For example: If the minimum points required for Rank 1 is 20,000 and Rank 2 is 15,000, but the user has 18,000 points (below the Rank 1 threshold), then this user will receive the Rank 2 reward instead.

Each referrer receives 40% of their allocated prize, while their referred valid new traders** share 60% of the same prize pool.

For example: If a Rank 1 referrer is eligible for 15% of a $150,000 total prize pool:Referrer receives: 40% * 15% * $150,000 = $9,000 worth of random tokensValid new traders share: 60% * 15% * $150,000 = $13,500 worth of random tokens

**A valid new trader refers to a newly referred friend/referee who registers via the referrer’s Referral Pro link/code during the Promotion Period (after the referrer has confirmed participation), completes a cumulative trading volume of at least $100 via Binance Spot, Margin, Convert or Futures, and passes the platform’s risk assessment (including KYC processes).
