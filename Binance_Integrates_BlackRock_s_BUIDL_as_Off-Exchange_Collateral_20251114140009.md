# Binance Integrates BlackRock’s BUIDL as Off-Exchange Collateral

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region. 

Fellow Binancians,

Binance is expanding its collateral offerings for institutional off-exchange settlement services, Binance Banking Triparty, and MirrorRSV by adding support for the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), a tokenized short-term U.S. Treasury fund.

Additionally, a new BUIDL asset class will debut on the BNB Chain network, enhancing access and interoperability across on-chain applications.

This initiative reinforces Binance VIP & Institutional’s commitment to providing secure, compliant, and capital-efficient gateways between traditional finance and the blockchain ecosystem.

About Binance Banking Triparty

Binance Banking Triparty is a custodial solution designed for institutions that separates asset custody from trading execution. Users can trade on Binance by pledging fiat or fiat-equivalent collateral, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, held at a regulated third-party banking partner.

This structure is designed to mitigate counterparty risk and the support of tokenized RWAs for off-exchange collateral, and to allow institutions to earn yield on eligible assets while accessing Binance liquidity.

About MirrorRSV

MirrorRSV is an off-exchange custody solution developed by Ceffu, Binance’s institutional crypto custody partner. It allows users to trade on Binance while assets remain in segregated cold wallets, fully verifiable on-chain. This gives institutions enhanced transparency and auditability while retaining access to Binance’s liquidity.

About BUIDL

BUIDL is BlackRock’s first tokenized fund issued on a public blockchain. It is an interest-bearing USD institutional liquidity fund, issued on-chain by Securitize. The fund offers daily dividend payouts, 24/7 transferability, and is compatible with regulated custodians.

Key Features of This Integration

Through this integration, Binance VIP and Institutional users can now hold BUIDL off-exchange with Ceffu and Binance’s regulated, third-party banking partners, and enjoy yield on their collateral while trading seamlessly on Binance. By partnering with our banking triparty collaborators and crypto-native custody provider, Ceffu, we effectively address user needs and enable confident scaling of allocations while ensuring full regulatory compliance.

BUIDL now joins our list of supported tokenized yield-bearing assets, including USYC and cUSDO, which were integrated in July 2025.
