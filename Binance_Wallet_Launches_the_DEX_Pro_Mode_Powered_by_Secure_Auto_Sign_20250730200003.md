# Binance Wallet Launches the DEX Pro Mode Powered by Secure Auto Sign

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance Wallet is excited to introduce DEX Pro Mode: an upgrade that brings enhanced trading tools and a streamlined experience for advanced users. Powered by the innovative Secure Auto Sign feature, it enables a new kind of Limit Order that offers greater flexibility, improved cost-efficiency, and enhanced order management compared to limit orders on decentralized exchanges.

What’s New:

Pro Mode Tab: A new “DEX Pro Mode” tab is available under the Trade section, offering a streamlined interface tailored for advanced users. It surfaces token metrics such as market cap, liquidity, trading volume, and holder data directly within the trading flow. This removes the need to switch between the token detail page and trade interface.Limit Orders: Enable users to set target prices to buy or sell tokens. Once the market hits the target, the order is triggered - aiming for precise execution, though the final price may vary depending on market conditions.Secure Auto Sign: A feature that enables faster, more flexible Limit Orders by securely automating transaction signing via a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), all while keeping users in full control of their assets.

About Secure Auto Sign:

Secure Auto Sign enables fast and convenient transaction signing for Limit Orders, allowing users to place and manage orders more efficiently without repeated manual approvals. 

It operates within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): a secure and isolated hardware environment, ensuring private keys remain protected while users retain full self-custody. This gives users the flexibility to automate trading actions securely, without sacrificing control or security.

Key characteristics include:

Convenient and fast signing: Allows users to authorize transactions quickly and seamlessly, improving the trading experience without compromising control over private keys.Secure Isolation: Signing occurs in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), which ensures that only wallet owners can delegate signing rights. No one (including Binance or the hardware provider) can access private keys or execute unauthorized actions.Verifiable Self-custody: The system supports third-party verification to prove that private key isolation and transaction delegation remain intact, preserving user self-custody at all times.

Limit Orders Powered by Secure Auto Sign:

Binance Wallet’s Limit Orders, enhanced by Secure Auto Sign, address common challenges found on traditional decentralized exchanges by offering a more user-friendly and efficient trading experience:

No upfront gas fees: Unlike most DEXs, gas fees are charged only when an order executes, letting users cancel or modify orders without any cost.Funds remain unlocked: After placing a Limit Order, funds are not locked, allowing users to transact with them freely without canceling the order. When the target price is met, the system checks if sufficient funds are available to execute the order. If funds are initially insufficient but later replenished within the price target window, the order can still be executed.Multiple pending orders: The same wallet balance can be used to place multiple pending orders simultaneously, enabling more flexible trading strategies. This is particularly useful for traders targeting specific price points across multiple tokens — whichever token reaches its price target first will be bought or sold. 

How to Use Limit Orders in Pro Mode:

Navigate to [Trade] > [Pro Mode].Select the Limit Order as the order type.Choose the token, price, and amount.Enable Secure Auto Sign to authorize the order.Submit the order.

Notes:

Users should ensure sufficient funds are available in their wallet when the Limit Order price is reached for successful execution.To place Limit Orders, users need to enable Secure Auto Sign (SAS) by authorizing it the first time they use the feature. Each SAS session is backed by a secure authorization that expires based on user activity.The initial Secure Auto Sign (SAS) authorization is valid for 7 days.Each time a new Limit Order is placed, the 7-day period resets automatically.If the session expires, re-authorization can be done during the next order or manually via Settings > Secure Auto Sign.If there’s no qualifying activity for 7 days, the session will expire. Secure Auto Sign can be reauthorized at any time when placing or managing new Limit Orders.The authorization prompt will appear only once when users place their first Limit Order.After initial setup, users can manage or revoke this permission anytime via Settings > Secure Auto Sign.
