Binance Alpha features emerging digital assets which are not listed on the Binance Exchange and which are generally expected to have a low market capitalization and unique or novel characteristics. The inclusion of a digital asset as a Binance Alpha asset does not in any way imply, directly or indirectly, that such digital asset will be listed on Binance Exchange in the future. As digital asset prices can be volatile, the value of any investment that you make in Alpha Assets may go down or up and you may lose all or part of the value of the amount that you invest. Please note that in relation to Binance Alpha (i) the risk of loss of all or part of your investment is magnified with Binance Alpha assets as they are subject to increased price volatility (ii) by purchasing Alpha Assets, you are exposed to price slippage and blockchain fees, which can have a negative impact of the price of Alpha Assets (iii) Alpha Assets cannot be withdrawn from the Binance Exchange, and you will only be able to access Alpha Assets from your Alpha Account only. You are solely responsible for your investment decisions. Binance will not in any circumstances be responsible or liable for any losses that you may incur arising directly or indirectly from an investment in Binance Alpha Assets.
