Introducing Binance HODLer Airdrops

Binance HODLer Airdrops is a program that rewards BNB holders with token airdrops based on historical snapshots of their BNB balances. By subscribing BNB to Simple Earn, users are automatically eligible for HODLer Airdrops (as well as Launchpool and Megadrop rewards). By subscribing BNB to On-Chain Yields, users are automatically eligible for HODLer Airdrops and Launchpool rewards.

Unlike other earning methods that require ongoing actions, HODLer Airdrops reward users retroactively, offering a simple way to earn additional tokens. By subscribing BNB to Simple Earn products and/or On-Chain Yields, users can automatically qualify for token rewards.

How to Benefit from HODLer Airdrops

Binance will use historical snapshots of user balances at random periods after this announcement to calculate user rewards. For example, reward calculation for HODLer Airdrops on 2024-06-11 may use snapshots of user balances between 2024-06-01 to 2024-06-07 as reference.Eligible users will receive HODLer Airdrops rewards in their Spot Accounts within 24 hours after the HODLer Airdrops is announced.
