# Important Updates to Binance Link and Trade Rebate Structures

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians, 

As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the Binance Link Program, we are restructuring our rebates model for the Link and Trade program. The program offers trading rebates to eligible partners when users connect directly to Binance through the partnerâ€™s trading platform.  

Effective 2025-10-01 00:00 (UTC), Link and Trade brokers who do not meet the minimum requirements of the Bronze tier during a given quarter will be disqualified from the programme and will no longer be eligible to receive any rebates. 

Additionally, the default base rebates of 20% on Binance Spot and 10% on Binance Futures will be discontinued. We encourage our Binance Link clients to review the Bronze tier requirements to ensure eligibility and compliance to maintain access to rebates and program benefits.

Thank you for your support!
