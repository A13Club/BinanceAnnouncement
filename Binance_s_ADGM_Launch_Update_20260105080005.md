# Binance’s ADGM Launch Update

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Further to our prior announcement regarding our transition to a new ADGM-regulated structure, we confirm that these changes are now effective and apply to your use of the platform from 2026-01-05 08:00 (UTC).

These updates implement the regulatory, contractual, clearing, and custody changes previously described and re-stated below and are designed to provide greater clarity, oversight, and risk management across our operations.

For reference, users may review the prior advance notice announcement dated 2025-12-08. 

1. New ADGM Regulatory Structure 

From 2026-01-05, services on the platform are provided through three ADGM-licensed entities, each operating in accordance with its regulatory permissions:

Nest Exchange Limited (formerly known as Nest Services Limited): Recognized Investment Exchange, with a stipulation to operate a Multilateral Trading Facility, responsible for all exchange activities, including spot and derivatives trading.Nest Clearing and Custody Limited (formerly known as Binance (AD) Limited): Recognised Clearing House, with a stipulation to provide custody, responsible for clearing and settlement, acting as the central counterparty for on-exchange derivatives trades, and safeguarding user digital assets.Nest Trading Limited (formerly known as BCI Limited): Broker-Dealer, responsible for off-exchange activities and principal-based services (e.g., OTC trading, Convert, Earn).

This structure mirrors established financial market infrastructures, with clear separation of responsibilities and strengthened risk controls.

2. Changes to Service Providers 

To align with this structure, our contractual arrangements with users have now been updated.

Historically, services were mainly provided by Nest Exchange Limited. From 2026-01-05 onwards, services are provided by Nest Exchange Limited, Nest Clearing and Custody Limited, and Nest Trading Limited.

The rights and obligations under the existing Terms of Use have now been novated to the relevant ADGM entities. This means that your contractual relationship now continues with the ADGM-regulated entities in respect of the services that they each provide.

The product-specific terms, which have also been updated, now identify the service provider responsible for each product under the new structure.

3. Changes to Data Controllers

From the launch date, each ADGM-regulated entity acts as a separate data controller for the services that it provides.

Please refer to our dedicated Privacy FAQs for further information.

4. Updated Terms of Use and Privacy Notice 

As part of this transition, our Terms of Use, Privacy Notice, and related legal documentation have been updated and are now in effect, replacing the previous versions.

5. Clearing and Custody Arrangements

Nest Clearing and Custody Limited also acts as the custodian of user digital assets, subject to limited exceptions described below.

The following assets will continue to be held by Nest Exchange Limited:
