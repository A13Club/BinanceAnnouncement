1. Social Hype

Social Hype is a new feature that analyzes social data to help users understand which tokens are gaining attention across the community. Located under the Markets tab, this feature ranks tokens across all chains on Binance Wallet (Web): BSC, SOL, and BASE. It is based on certain hype metrics, like social post views and engagement, that provides timely smart insight for users. 

Key Features

Hype Leaderboard: Ranks tokens based on the Hype Score, which reflects the number of views and social visibility. Mindshare: A visual overview showing how social attention is distributed in real-time across tokens over different time periods. Users can track activity over the past 24 hours (1h view), over the last week (4h view), or across the last 30 days (24h view). This feature helps users gauge the momentum of a token’s hype.Hype Rising: A ranking of tokens showing the strongest short-term increases in social activity.

The Social Hype feature uses Binance Wallet’s latest AI technology to scan social posts, identify mentioned tokens (e.g., $TOKEN), and summarize sentiment. Users can open and view relevant posts directly.
