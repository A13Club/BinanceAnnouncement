# Introducing Trading Signals on Binance Wallet

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance is excited to introduce Trading Signals on Binance Wallet, a new feature designed to help users discover potential trading opportunities based on on-chain trading activities and AI-powered sentiment analysis. These latest updates build on Binance’s proprietary AI capabilities, which were introduced as part of the release of AI-powered features in the redesigned Binance app and in AI Token Reports.

With this update, users can access three types of signals directly within Binance Wallet:

Smart Money Signalsa. Smart Money Signalsb. Smart Money KOL SignalsSentiment Signals

Users can opt in to receive notifications every time a new Smart Money, Smart KOL, or Sentiment Signal is triggered. Coupled with the Signal Quick Buy function, which users can choose to use, users can then buy the desired tokens once they receive the notification.

For more details on how the Trading Signals features work, users can refer to the pop-up guide on the trading page.

Smart Money Signals:

Based on on-chain data, this signal identifies tokens purchased by top-performing blockchain addresses referred to as “Smart Money”. A signal is triggered when a significant number of these addresses purchase the same token within a short time window. 

Key features include:

“Smart Money” address detection: Our algorithm identifies top-performing addresses based on various factors, including historical return on investment (ROI), win rate and profit and loss (PnL) metrics.Token Selection: Activates based on the number of Smart Money addresses buying a token and amount spent within a short time window.Signal Aggregation: In case there are multiple signals for the same token, they will be aggregated into one signal. Signal Lifecycle: Displays a progress bar with the Smart Money Exit Rate to help users with their purchase decisionToken Narrative: Provides an AI-generated summary of each token’s background, milestones, and factors, driving interest.Mini-Kline: A specific price chart to showcase the price action before or after the signal.

Smart KOL Signals:

Smart KOL Signals operate similarly to Smart Money Signals, except that the monitored addresses belong to some of the top-performing Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in the crypto meme trading community. A signal is triggered when a significant number of these KOL addresses purchase the same token within a short time frame. 

Smart KOL Signals can be found under Smart Money Signals. Users can view information including their names, addresses, 30-day win rate, and profit and loss (PnL).

Sentiment Signals:

Powered by AI-driven sentiment analysis, this signal is generated from social media activities on X. It includes data such as mention volume, sentiment classification (bullish, bearish, positive, negative, or neutral), hype growth indicators, trending topics, and key accounts discussing the token.

Key features include:

Sentiment Analysis:  Generated from diverse X posts, including general users and Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs).Hype Detection: Our algorithm identifies trending tokens on X based on real-time rise in visibility and engagement.Discussion overview: Each signal provides a quick AI-generated snapshot of discussions, hype growth percentage, and overall sentiment (bullish, bearish, positive, negative, or neutral).
