Locked New BNB Score (New BNB Locked Products Subscriptions)This score is based on the new amount of BNB Locked Products the user subscribed to during the Promotion Period. The longer the locked period, the higher the score multiplier.120-day Locked: Net BNB Amount * 490-day Locked: Net BNB Amount * 360-day Locked: Net BNB Amount * 2.530-day Locked: Net BNB Amount * 215-day Locked: Net BNB Amount * 1Auto-Subscribed positions that renew during the Promotion Period will count towards the Locked New BNB Score. BNB Loyalty Bonus (Existing BNB Locked Products Subscriptions)To reward our long-term supporters, we are offering a bonus for BNB Locked Product positions that were active before the Promotion Period and remain active throughout.120-day Locked: Existing BNB Amount * 190-day Locked: Existing BNB Amount * 0.7560-day Locked: Existing BNB Amount * 0.630-day Locked: Existing BNB Amount * 0.515-day Locked: Existing BNB Amount * 0.25Redemption PenaltyA penalty will be applied if a user redeems BNB from Locked Products before the lock terms end (early-redemption) during the campaign period, resulting in a deduction in the Total Campaign Score. The penalty is calculated as: Redeemed BNB Locked Products Amount * 4Any existing BNB Locked Products positions that mature during the Promotion Period while Auto-Subscribe was turned off will not incur any deduction in the Total Campaign Score.AI MultiplierHolding at least 1,500 AI Flexible Products net volume by the last day of the Promotion Period gives the user a 3x multiplier.Otherwise, the multiplier is 1x.

Example of User A: 

Before the Promotion Period (Loyalty Bonus): 50 BNB in 120-day Locked Products and 20 BNB in 60-day Locked Products.During the Promotion Period : Subscribed 30 BNB to 90-day Locked Products and 10 BNB to 30-day Locked Products.During the Promotion Period : Redeemed 5 BNB from 90-day Locked Products.AI Holdings: Subscribed 2,000 AI to Flexible Products on the 3rd day of the Promotion Period and did not redeem before the Promotion Period ends.

Total Campaign Score = (Locked New BNB Score + BNB Loyalty Bonus - Redemption Penalty) * Promotion Period Multiplier * AI Multiplier

User A’s Total Campaign Score: 

= [(30* 3) + (10* 2) + (50* 1) + (20* 0.6) - (5* 4)] *3

= (90 + 20 + 50 + 12 - 20) * 3

= 152 * 3

= 456
