Fellow Binancians,

Binance Futures will introduce the Retail Price Improvement (RPI) Order feature on 2025-11-20, aimed at enhancing market liquidity and providing retail users with better execution quality.

Key Highlights

Post-Only Liquidity Enhancement: RPI Orders are post-only, ensuring they always add liquidity to the order book (i.e. maker order) and never execute as taker orders. This mechanism supports deeper liquidity and improved retail trading conditions.Exclusive Matching: RPI Orders are designed to match exclusively with non-algorithmic taker orders. These orders are not visible to or accessible by API takers, helping to create a more balanced trading environment for retail participants.Available to All Users: All users eligible for Binance Futures will be able to access the RPI Order feature. API users are advised to review the integration details and update their systems in time to support the new order type.Selected Symbols with Special Fee Structure: The RPI feature will initially be available on selected symbols, supported by a dedicated fee structure designed to incentivize participation and enhance liquidity.

Notes:

Binance will complete the full launch of the Retail Price Improvement (RPI) function by 2025-11-20. Users may or may not have access to this function until after 2025-11-20.
