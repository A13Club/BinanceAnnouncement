Other than Kepple (QLC) token, users will still be able to deposit or withdraw the following tokens via other networks supported by Binance.

Please note:

It is strongly recommended for users holding QLC tokens to withdraw their remaining tokens before 2025-10-15 08:00 (UTC) as transfer of assets will cease after the shutdown.There may be discrepancies between this original content in English and any translated versions.
