Fellow Binancians,

We’re thrilled to introduce these powerful new features that will take the Binance Affiliate experience to the next level! Affiliates can now effortlessly grow their communities with smarter engagement tools, maximize earnings through enhanced insights and timely commission tracking, and enjoy seamless daily support with quick access to dedicated assistance anytime it is needed. These updates are designed to ensure a smoother, more rewarding journey for all affiliates.

1. Grow Your Community

Co-Inviter Program

Binance is excited to introduce the Co-Inviter program, a feature designed exclusively for Affiliates.  Affiliates can now share a portion of their commission percentage with any non-affiliate Binance user as a Co-Inviter through a personalized commission-sharing method. Affiliates have the flexibility to set the commission percentages for Co-Inviters and rebate percentages for invitees, ensuring a flexible and mutually rewarding partnership. Commissions generated from invited users will be shared between Co-Inviters and Affiliates accordingly.

Each affiliate can collaborate with up to 50 Co-Inviters, maximizing their impact. A clear commission dashboard and detailed analytics help affiliates effectively manage Co-Inviter data, while Co-Inviters have a dedicated portal to track their link performance.

This feature is designed to help affiliates better integrate resources, drive viral growth and user conversion, and ultimately increase earnings. 

For detailed rules, please refer to the FAQ. 

Optimized Futures Rebates

The Futures rebate structure has been enhanced to offer clearer and more competitive rewards. All users can easily customize and share up to 20% of their commission with their invited friends by adjusting a progress bar. If the commission rate is below 20%, users can allocate the entire amount as a rebate to their invitees. This flexible sharing option enables affiliates to tailor incentives, increase referral benefits, and effectively expand their network to maximize earnings.

Please note that once the adjustment is confirmed, the Futures commission ratio for all your Standard Codes cannot be modified again. The updated ratio will apply to all current and new Standard Code invitees, except for current invitees who already have a higher Futures rate, which will remain unchanged.

2. Maximize Your Earnings:

Spot & Futures Evaluations

All eligible users can automatically get upgraded to enjoy commission rates of up to 50% on both Spot and Futures trading. The Futures Evaluation has been live since August 2025, and the Spot Evaluation was launched on 2025-10-01. All evaluation processes are now fully automated, ensuring a seamless experience. The performance-driven commission structure features automatic commission evaluations and rate adjustments. Click here to learn more.
