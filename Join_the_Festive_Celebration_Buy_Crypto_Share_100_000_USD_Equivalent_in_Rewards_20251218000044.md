Reward Calculation:

Users must have accumulated at least 1,000 activity points in total during the Promotion Period to be eligible for a share of the respective prize pools. New users: All eligible new users who have completed one of the missions (from Mission 1 to Mission 4) will share the 50,000 USD equivalent prize pool proportionally based on the activity points they have earned from this campaign during the Promotion Period, capped at 20 USD equivalent per user.Example : A user earns 2,000 activity points, and the total activity points earned by all eligible new users is 10,000,000. This means the user’s share of the prize pool is 2,000/10,000,000 = 0.02%. 

Existing users: All eligible users who have completed one of the missions (from Mission 1 to Mission 4) and have accumulated a total purchase volume of at least 200 USD equivalent during the Promotion Period will share the 50,000 USD equivalent prize pool proportionally based on the activity points they have earned from this campaign during the Promotion Period, capped at 10 USD equivalent per user. Example : A user earns 3,000 activity points, and the total activity points earned by all eligible existing users is 10,000,000. This means the user’s share of the prize pool is 3,000/10,000,000 = 0.03%.
