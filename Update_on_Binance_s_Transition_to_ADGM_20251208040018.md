# Update on Binance’s Transition to ADGM

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region. 

Fellow Binancians,

We are pleased to announce that Binance has received full regulatory authorization from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of ADGM to operate its global platform under a comprehensive, internationally-recognized regulatory framework. This represents an important milestone in our long-term commitment to building a trusted, transparent, and resilient global digital-asset platform.

In line with ADGM FSRA requirements, our operations will transition to a new regulatory structure designed to enhance clarity, oversight, and risk management across the platform.

1. New ADGM Regulatory Structure

From 2026-01-06 08:00 (UTC), Binance services will be provided through three ADGM-licensed entities, each playing a specific role in accordance with its regulatory permissions:

Nest Exchange Services Limited: Recognized Investment Exchange (with a stipulation to operate a multilateral trading facility), responsible for all exchange activities, including spot and derivative trading.Nest Clearing and Custody Limited: Recognized Clearing House (with a stipulation to provide custody), responsible for clearing and settlement, acting as the central counterparty for on-exchange derivative trades, and safeguarding user digital assets.Nest Trading Limited: Broker-Dealer, responsible for off-exchange activities and principal-based services (e.g., OTC trading, Convert, Earn).

This structure essentially mirrors the regulatory architectures used in traditional finance, separating responsibilities, strengthening risk controls, and creating clear safeguards for users. In practical terms, it means every part of our operations, from matching trades to storing assets, runs under precise, purpose-built regulatory permissions.

2. Changes to Binance Service Providers 

To align with this new regulatory structure, we are updating our contractual arrangements with users.

Historically, all Binance services were mainly provided by Nest Services Limited (to be renamed ’Nest Exchange Limited’ upon licensing). From 2026-01-05, those Binance services will instead be provided by Nest Exchange Services Limited, Nest Clearing and Custody Limited, and Nest Trading Limited.

To facilitate this transition, the rights and obligations under Binance.com users’ existing Terms of Use will be automatically novated to the relevant ADGM entities pursuant to the novation clause in the current Terms of Use (Clause 36.5). This means that, effective 2026-01-05, your contractual relationship will continue with the ADGM-regulated entities in respect of the different services that they each provide.

The product-specific terms will also be updated to clearly identify the service provider responsible for that product / service under the new structure.

3. Changes to Binance Data Controllers

From 2026-01-05 08:00 (UTC), each ADGM regulated entity will act as a data controller for the services that it provides. 

Please refer to our dedicated Privacy FAQs for further information.

4. Updated Terms of Use and Privacy Notice

As part of this transition, we are updating our Terms of Use and Privacy Notice. The updated documents will take effect on 2026-01-05, replacing the current versions.

We are sharing the Updated Terms of Use and the Updated Privacy Notice now to provide for advance review ahead of the effective date.

You can confirm your agreement to the novation and the updated Terms of Use by clicking the confirmation button that will appear in your account. Continued use of the services from today also constitutes acceptance of these changes.

5. Clearing and Custody Arrangements

On 2026-01-05, users’ open positions for on-exchange derivative transactions will be 'given up' for clearing to Nest Clearing and Custody Limited, which will act as a central counterparty. Nest Clearing and Custody Limited will also act as the custodian of user digital assets.

6. How These Changes Affect You 

The changes relate to regulatory structuring and are not meant to alter the way that you interact with the platform.

Your day-to-day use of the platform will remain substantially the same:

You will continue to access the platform using your existing UID and login credentials.Balances, order history, and trading functionality will be unaffected.The products and services available to you, except that they will be provided by different Binance regulated entities.Your existing orders and positions will also remain open and materially unchanged, except that they may be transferred to the relevant Binance regulated service provider.
