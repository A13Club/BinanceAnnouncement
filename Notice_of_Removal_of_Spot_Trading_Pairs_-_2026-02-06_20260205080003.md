Fellow Binancians,

To protect users and maintain a high quality trading market, Binance conducts periodic reviews of all listed spot trading pairs, and may delist selected spot trading pairs due to multiple factors, such as poor liquidity and trading volume.

Based on our most recent reviews, Binance will remove and cease trading on the following spot trading pairs:

At 2026-02-06 08:00 (UTC): AUDIO/BTC, BB/FDUSD, BERA/FDUSD, EIGEN/BTC, FIDA/BTC, HEI/BTC, IOTX/ETH, KERNEL/FDUSD, MANTA/BTC, MTL/BTC, NEAR/FDUSD, PEOPLE/FDUSD, RENDER/FDUSD, RONIN/BTC, SAPIEN/BNB, SCR/BTC, S/ETH, S/FDUSD, SUSHI/BTC and VANA/FDUSD

Please Note:

The delisting of a spot trading pair does not affect the availability of the tokens on Binance Spot. Users can still trade the spot trading pair's base and quote assets on other trading pair(s) that are available on Binance.Binance will terminate Spot Trading Bots services for the aforementioned spot trading pairs at 2026-02-06 08:00 (UTC) where applicable.
