This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians, 

As part of Binance’s ongoing commitment to deliver competitive services, Binance Earn is excited to introduce two major upgrades to Dual Investment, effective immediately. These improvements provide greater flexibility and customization on the Auto-compound plan to better suit users’ investment strategies.

Key Updates

1. Expanded Settlement Days for BTC and ETH 

Tailor strategy by selecting any business day within the next 7 days as the settlement date. For example, on Tuesday, users can subscribe to the products with settlement dates from Wednesday to Friday, and the following Monday.

Supported Pairs: BTC/USD*, ETH/USD*.Subscriptions close at 15:59 (UTC) on the day before the chosen settlement date. 

2. Customizable Auto-compound Plan

The Auto-compound Plan allows users to automatically reinvest both their investment amount and rewards into a new product based on their preset criteria upon settlement. Features include:

Ability to set desired APR expectation, target price difference, and settlement date.Support for Auto-reverse, allowing reinvestment into the opposite direction of the original subscription when the target price is reached.Users must update their Binance App to version 3.1.0 or later to access this feature. Subscriptions made using older versions will not be eligible for the Auto-compound Plan.

Note: If no product is available before 16:00 (UTC) on the settlement date, funds will be refunded to users’ Spot Account. Additionally, if the preset settlement day is not available for a specific token, funds will be refunded upon settlement without entering the Auto-compound plan.

Example: 

User A invested $110,000 USDT in Buy Low BTC. On the settlement date, their investment settles to 1.01 BTC. 

Auto-compound PlanMinimum APR ≥ 50%Investment duration = 5 daysTarget price difference $1,000

With Auto-Reverse EnabledReinvestment will proceed automatically if a matching product is found before 16:00 (UTC) on the settlement date. (e.g., a BTC Sell High product with an APR of ≥ 50% and a target price of ≥ $101,000 (market price $100,000 + $1,000)).If no matching product is found, 1.01 BTC will be returned to User A’s Spot Account.Without Auto-Reverse Enabled1.01 BTC will be returned to User A’s Spot Account directly after the original subscription settles.
