# Binance Margin Will Update the Collateral Ratio of Multiple Parameters for Cross Margin Mode (2026-01-21)

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance Margin will update the Collateral Ratio for the maximum borrowing limit (Cross Margin Classic only) and the maximum transfer-out limit (both Cross Margin Classic and Cross Margin Pro modes), effective from 2026-01-21 13:00 (UTC). The update will be completed within approximately 60 minutes.

Key Updates:

The previously unified collateral ratio will now be divided into three separate ratios: the Borrow Collateral Ratio, the Transfer-Out Collateral Ratio and the Liquidation Collateral Ratio. Each ratio will control one specific parameter — the Borrow Collateral Ratio will set the maximum borrowing limit; the Transfer-Out Collateral Ratio will set the maximum transfer-out limit; and the Liquidation Collateral Ratio will determine the liquidation.The ratios for the Borrow Margin Level and the Transfer-Out Margin Level will be calculated using the updated collateral ratios set out below:.
