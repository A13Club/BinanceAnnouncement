Fellow Binancians,

From 2026-01-23 00:00 (UTC), Binance will launch an airdrop campaign rewarding all eligible users who hold World Liberty Financial USD (USD1) on our platform. Eligible users will share rewards from a grand prize pool of $40 million in World Liberty Financial (WLFI). 

WLFI will be distributed as weekly rewards to USD1 holders during the Activity period. The first airdrop distribution will be on 2026-02-02, covering the reward period from 2026-01-23 00:00 (UTC) to 2026-01-30 00:00 (UTC). Subsequent rewards will be distributed every Friday thereafter.

Campaign Period: 2026-01-23 00:00 (UTC) till 2026-02-20 00:00 (UTC)

How to Participate:

Eligible users must hold USD1 in balance (net assets), in any of the following account categories on Binance:

Spot Account;Funding Account;Margin Account (USD1 as Collateral in Cross Margin, Isolated Margin or Portfolio Margin); USDⓈ-M Futures Account (USD1 as Collateral in USDⓈ-M Futures Accounts, Multi-asset mode is included).

Note: USD1 as Collaterals in Binance Futures or Margin accounts can receive a 1.2x bonus multiplier on rewards.

Campaign Details

Prize Pool: $40 million in WLFI tokens will be distributed over 4 weekly installments ($10 million in WLFI tokens each week).  Distribution: Rewards will be airdropped directly to users’ Binance Spot accounts.  Distribution Frequency: Weekly airdrops during the Campaign Period. 

Reward Distribution

Rewards start accruing from 2026-01-23 00:00 (UTC). The first airdrop distribution will be on 2026-02-02, covering the reward period from 2026-01-23 00:00 (UTC) to 2026-01-30 00:00 (UTC). Subsequent rewards will be distributed by 18:00 (UTC) every Friday in WLFI token. Distribution records can be found in your Distribution history.

The Weekly Reward Amount will be roughly calculated as follows:

Qualifying Balance of each day = Lowest USD1 balance captured during those hourly snapshots on each day.Weekly Rewards = (7-day average of the Qualifying Balance * effective APR on the distribution day * 7) ÷ 365 

In determining the effective APR on the distribution day, Binance will take into account a number of factors, including, without limitation:

Lowest balance of the snapshots each day;The daily aggregated amount of Qualifying Balances across all eligible holders of USD1;7-day average across all eligible holders of USD1

Case example:

User A holds 10,000 USD1 in Spot and 20,000 USD1 as collateral in Margin throughout week 1, and effective base APR is 20%, effective boosted APR is 24%, User A's rewards due to be received at the end of week 1 will be as follows:

[(10,000 * 20% * 7) ÷ 365] + [(20,000 * 24% * 7) ÷ 365] = 130.41 USD worth of WLFI

User B borrowed 5,000 USD1 from VIP loan or Margin (“liabilities”). Among this borrowed 5,000 USD1, 4,000 USD1 was used as collateral in Margin, the remaining 1,000 USD1 was held in their Spot Account in week 1. The effective base APR is 20%, effective boosted APR is 24%, User B’s rewards due to be received at the end of week 1 will be as follows:

Qualifying Balance = 0 

[(0 * 20% * 7) / 365] + [(0 * 24% * 7) /365] = 0 USD worth of WLFI

Important Notes

Your USD1 Qualifying Balance will be calculated as net assets (assets minus liabilities). USD1 as liabilities (e.g. borrowed from VIP loans, Margin loan, etc) will be excluded from the Qualifying Balance for this campaign. Snapshots of user balances and total qualifying balances will be taken at any point of time each hour to get users’ hourly balances in the above mentioned account categories. The lowest USD1 balance captured during those snapshots on each day will constitute your Qualifying Balance and be used to calculate your rewards (for example, the lowest USD1 balance captured on 2026-02-01 is zero, then your qualifying balance for that day is zero.). At any snapshot time, any one of your supported assets must be greater than 0.01 USD1 to be included in the calculation.Make sure to maintain your USD1 holding throughout the Campaign Period to maximize your rewards.  Rewards distributed are rounded down to 8 decimal places. Rewards of sub-accounts will be distributed to the Spot Account of corresponding sub-accounts. Kindly note that the distribution time is not guaranteed and may change from time to time.Stay tuned for weekly reward distributions and updates on the Campaign.
