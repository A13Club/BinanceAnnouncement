# Binance Execution Services — Faster, More Efficient Trading for Large Crypto Orders

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance has enhanced its Execution Services to aggregate spot and options OTC quotes from the industry’s largest network of liquidity providers. This approach prioritizes flow internalization to reduce market impact, delivering tighter spreads, faster execution, and more competitive pricing for large crypto trades, all while upholding the privacy, security, and institutional-grade service you expect from Binance.

What’s Changed: Liquidity Provider Aggregation

As with traditional finance, over-the-counter trading lets large crypto orders be executed off the exchange order books. This reduces slippage, protects pricing, and preserves commercial confidentiality and avoids impacting the market. 

Binance Execution Services is designed for a wide range of users, from institutional investors such as hedge funds, asset managers, and family offices, to professional traders managing orders beyond typical retail sizes, as well as high-net-worth individuals.

Previously, our execution services depended primarily on liquidity from our proprietary native order books. With this latest update, Binance now aggregates quotes from multiple liquidity providers to ensure the best possible execution.
