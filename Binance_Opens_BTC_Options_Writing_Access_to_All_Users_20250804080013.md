# Binance Opens BTC Options Writing Access to All Users

This is a general announcement and marketing communication. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

We are pleased to announce that BTC Options writing access is now officially open to all Binance Options users. This expansion allows users to take advantage of more flexible and strategic trading opportunities, including expressing market views, managing risk, and enhancing yield through Options selling strategies.

Users can now write (sell) BTC Options directly on the Binance platform by upgrading their account to the Options “Long & Short Sell” trading mode.

Key Highlights of Binance Options:

Stablecoin-Denominated Options: Binance Options are priced and settled in stablecoins (currently only USDT). This makes cost and profit calculations more straightforward for investors than Coin-Margined Options, where the value of the underlying collateral may be more volatile. Competitive Fees: Binance is the largest crypto exchange in the world, working closely with sophisticated market makers to provide Options traders with competitive fees in the market and tight bid/ask spreads. Users will be able to enjoy a 20% discount on both Taker and Maker trading fees across all VIP levels on newly listed Options contracts.Flexible Strategies: Use writing to express directional views, hedge spot or futures exposure, or generate yield via covered calls and cash-secured puts.

Notes:

Options writing access to ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL, DOGE will remain limited to selected users for now. Users are required to upgrade their accounts to “Long & Short Sell” trading mode at Binance Options Trading Page to access Options writing.Users with over 100M USDT trading volume in 30 days and assets above 1,000,000 USDT are eligible to apply for Binance Options Enhanced Program. Eligible users can contact futures-business@binance.com or their Key Account Coverage Manager for details.There may be discrepancies between this original content in English and any translated versions.
