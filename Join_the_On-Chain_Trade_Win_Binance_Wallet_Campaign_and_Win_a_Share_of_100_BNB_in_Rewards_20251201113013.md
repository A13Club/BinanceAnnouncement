Campaign Rules:

During the campaign, participants must abide by the following rules:

Use Binance Wallet (Keyless) to register and conduct on-chain transactions. Transactions conducted via third-party DApps or non-Keyless wallets will not be counted. Once the wallet registration is confirmed, it cannot be changed during the Competition Period.The tokens traded must be on the BNB, ETH, Base, or SOL chains. Transactions on other chains will not be counted, and cross-chain transactions will not be counted.The trading pairs must include one of the following tokens: USDT, USDC, BNB, WBNB, SOL, WSOL, ETH, or WETH.PNL generated from trades between stablecoins, or between stablecoins and BNB, WBNB, SOL, WSOL, ETH, or WETH, will not be included in your PnL calculations. 

To qualify for the leaderboard, participants must meet the following criteria during the Competition Period:

Trade (buy and sell) at least three different tokens on the BNB, ETH, Base, or SOL chains (trades can be on one or multiple chains). All three tokens must be bought and sold on their same respective chains at least once to be eligible. The following tokens are not counted toward the requirement of trading three different tokens: USDT, USDC, BNB, WBNB, SOL, WSOL, ETH, or WETH.Example: A user trades the following trading pairs during the campaign:Buys and sells Token A using USDT on BNB chainBuys and sells Token B using SOL on BNB chainBuys and sells Token C using WETH on ETH chainBuys Token D using WSOL on SOL chain and sells Token D using WSOL on Base chainSince USDT, SOL, and WETH are excluded from the token count, the example counts as trading 3 different tokens (Token A, Token B, Token C) instead of 6 different tokens.In addition, since the user did not buy and sell Token D using WSOL on the same chain, this trade will not be considered eligible for the campaign.

Terms：Only realized PnL from tokens bought and sold during the Competition Period will be counted; tokens held or transferred before the competition starts, along with their PnL, will not be included.Yield-generating activities such as earning and staking will not be counted towards your PnL.Only one account per user is allowed. If multiple accounts are found sharing the same IP address, UID, etc., this will be deemed a violation and these accounts will be disqualified.Users may choose to link their X account to display on the leaderboard and must ensure that the content of their linked X account complies with all laws and regulations. If any illegal content is involved, the platform reserves the right to unconditionally hide or unlink the account.Market fluctuation risk is borne by the participant, and the organizer is not responsible for losses caused by abnormal market fluctuations. 

Realized PnL Calculation Example：

Realized PnL = (Sell Amount / Sell Quantity - Buy Amount / Buy Quantity) * Sell Quantity = (Sell Price per Token - Buy Price per Token) * Sell Quantity 

Example: Suppose a user buys 100 Token A at a price of 1 USDT each. Later, the price of Token A rises to 2 USDT, and the user decides to sell 90 tokens. 

Realized PnL = (180/90 - 90/90) * 90 = (2 - 1) * 90 = 90 USDT

* Since only 90 tokens are sold, we use the buy cost of those 90 tokens (the remaining 10 tokens are still unrealized).

Note: This formula is a simplified version; the actual calculation must strictly follow the rules described above.
