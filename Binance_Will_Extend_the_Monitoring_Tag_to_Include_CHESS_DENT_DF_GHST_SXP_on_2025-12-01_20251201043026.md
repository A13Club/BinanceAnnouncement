Fellow Binancians,

Based on recent reviews, Binance will extend the Monitoring Tag to include more tokens on 2025-12-01.

The tokens to be added to the Monitoring Tag list are: 

Tranchess (CHESS)Dent (DENT)dForce (DF)Aavegotchi (GHST)Solar (SXP)

Tokens with the Monitoring Tag exhibit notably higher volatility and risks compared to other listed tokens. These tokens are closely monitored, with regular reviews conducted. Keep in mind that tokens with the Monitoring Tag are at risk of no longer meeting our listing criteria and being delisted from the platform. 

To gain trading access to tokens marked with the Monitoring Tag, users will need to pass the quiz every 90 days on the Binance Spot and/or Binance Margin platforms, and accept the Terms of Use. The quizzes are set up to ensure users are aware of the risks before trading tokens with the Monitoring Tag. Users may find the Monitoring Tags and on the corresponding Binance Spot and Binance Margin trading pages, as well as on the Markets Overview page. A risk warning banner will also be displayed for all tokens with the Monitoring Tags.

Binance will conduct periodic project reviews and decide if the Monitoring Tag should be added to or removed from tokens as per its latest findings. These criteria are considered during the review:
