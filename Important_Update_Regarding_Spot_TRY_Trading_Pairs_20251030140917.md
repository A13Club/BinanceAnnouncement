# Important Update Regarding Spot TRY Trading Pairs

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

In line with our commitment to regulatory compliance in Türkiye, Binance is introducing changes to the trading of Turkish Lira (TRY) pairs on Binance Spot.

To ensure uninterrupted access to TRY trading pairs on Binance.com, users must have a verified Binance TR account by 2025-11-27. We encourage users who do not have a verified Binance TR account yet to begin the registration and verification process on Binance TR starting from 2025-10-30, to complete identity verification (KYC) before the deadline.

If you don’t yet have a verified Binance TR account, please visit the official Binance TR website or download the mobile app to register and verify your account. Eligible users will regain access to TRY trading pairs once verification is completed.If you already have a verified Binance TR account or you are the qualified TRY Fiat liquidity provider, no further action is required — you can continue trading TRY pairs as usual.For users who are not eligible to open a Binance TR account (i.e., non-Turkish citizens) or choose not to, alternative options such as the Convert feature will remain available to manage TRY balances.

Please note that this update applies only to TRY Spot trading. Users who do not complete verification, or are ineligible to open a Binance TR account, will no longer be able to place TRY Spot orders or access TRY trading pairs on Binance.com after 2025-11-13 00:00 (UTC), but users will still be able to see their open orders on the Spot trading page and cancel those orders themselves.

We kindly remind all users to complete verification or manage their open orders before 2025-11-27 to avoid any disruption. All remaining open orders from ineligible users will be automatically canceled after 2025-11-27 00:00 (UTC).

For any questions or assistance, our Customer Support team is available 24/7. More details on how to create and verify a Binance TR account can be found here.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation as we continue to align our operations with local regulatory requirements.

Register now on Binance TR via the official website or mobile app.

Thank you for your support!
