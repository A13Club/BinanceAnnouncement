# Introducing the Pre-TGE Prime Sale Edition on Binance Wallet

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region. Terms and conditions apply.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance Wallet is excited to introduce the Pre-Token Generation Event (Pre-TGE) Prime Sale edition. In comparison with other Pre-TGE offerings, this new model is designed to provide users with early access to relatively more mature projects that demonstrate a higher level of development. The opportunity to acquire tokens from these projects has traditionally been less accessible to most users prior to the projects' Token Generation Event (TGE). The Pre-TGE Prime Sale edition builds on the familiar Binance Wallet Pre-TGE experience but focuses on expanding access to these projects.

The first project to launch with this Pre-TGE model is expected to be announced at 2025-10-10 13:30 (UTC) on the official Binance Wallet X account.

How Does the Pre-TGE Prime Sale Edition Work 

The Pre-TGE Prime Sale edition mechanism functions similarly to previous Pre-TGEs held on Binance Wallet. 

During the Prime Sale, users can subscribe to the project token, exclusively within the Binance Wallet. The subscription process follows an over-subscription model, allowing deposits up to a prespecified amount of BNB per user. Token allocation is proportional to the total BNB deposited by all participants. 

After the subscription period ends, users will be able to claim their allocated tokens, which can be claimed via the [Assets] tab. These tokens will be credited to their accounts, but will remain non-tradeable until the official launch date, as announced by the project. Any excess BNB will be automatically refunded. 

Benefits of the Pre-TGE Prime Sale 

Project Maturity: Compared with traditional TGEs and Pre-TGEs on Binance Wallet, the Pre-TGE Prime Sale features projects that are comparatively more mature.Broader Project Access: This model features projects that, due to their advanced development, have traditionally been less accessible to most users.Verified User Base: The Pre-TGE Prime Sale links projects with a real, verified, and vast user base to foster genuine engagement.Larger Sale Amounts: The Pre-TGE Prime Sale tends to have larger sale amounts, allowing more users to participate or users to purchase more tokens, increasing accessibility and engagement.Fair Distribution: Participants benefit from fair token distribution through transparent and predefined allocation mechanisms.

Pre-TGE Prime Sale Timeline:

Phase 1: BNB Deposit Subscription

Eligible users may participate by depositing up to the maximum allowed amount of BNB during the Subscription Period. Users should ensure their deposits do not exceed the maximum individual cap.

Phase 2: Token Allocation (Non-Tradable

)Upon subscription completion, users will be able to claim their allocated tokens based on the final calculation. These tokens will be credited to their accounts, but will remain non-tradeable until the official launch date, as announced by the project.

Phase 3: Trading Opens on Binance Alpha

Once the token is officially live, users will be able to freely trade their allocated tokens on Binance Alpha.

Prime Sale Keys

Some Pre-TGE Prime Sales incorporate Prime Sale Keys in their mechanics (specifically under Phase 2), but not all campaigns will use this method. When included,  Prime Sale Keys are  stored in the user’s wallet that serves as proof of a successful subscription. These keys are non-tradable and have no monetary value. After the subscription period ends, users can claim the Prime Sale Keys in their wallets as a proof of successful subscription along with any unused subscription funds.
