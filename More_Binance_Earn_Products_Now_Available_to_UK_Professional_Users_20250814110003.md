Fellow Binancians,

We’re pleased to share that more selected Binance Earn products are now available to qualifying UK Professional Users* on Binance.com.

For some time, regulatory constraints in the United Kingdom meant that Binance had to restrict access to certain Earn features that were staking, savings, and loans in nature for UK users.

Following recent developments in the UK regulation on staking being exempt from the classification as a collective investment scheme, and following further review of our approach to the applicable exemptions under the UK financial promotions regime, Binance is now able to offer the following Earn products to qualifying UK Professional Users as well:
