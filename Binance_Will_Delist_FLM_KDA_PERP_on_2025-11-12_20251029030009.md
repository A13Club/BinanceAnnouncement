Fellow Binancians,

At Binance, we periodically review each digital asset we list to ensure that it continues to meet a high level of standard and industry requirements. When a coin or token no longer meets these standards or the industry landscape changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it. Our priority is to ensure the best services and protections for our users while continuing to adapt to evolving market dynamics. 

When we conduct these reviews, we consider a variety of factors. Below are the updated metrics we look at that influence whether we decide to delist a digital asset:  

Commitment of team to projectLevel and quality of development activityTrading volume and liquidityStability and safety of network from attacksLevel of public communication, community engagement, and transparencyResponsiveness to our periodic due diligence requestsEvidence of unethical/fraudulent conduct or negligenceNew regulatory requirementsMaterial/unjustified increase in token supply or changes to tokenomicsImpact from changes to the project’s ownership structure or to the core team membersCommunity sentiments
