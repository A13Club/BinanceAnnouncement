Pieverse Pre-TGE 

During the Pre-TGE event, users can subscribe to PIEVERSE tokens, exclusively within the Binance Wallet. The subscription process follows an over-subscription model, allowing up to 3 BNB deposits per user. Token allocation is proportional to the total BNB deposited by all participants. After the Subscription Period ends, users can claim their PIEVERSE tokens via the [Assets] tab, and the unused BNB will be automatically refunded. Important: As this is a Pre-TGE event, PIEVERSE tokens claimed through this event are subject to a mandatory lock-up period and will not be immediately tradable after the campaign. Tokens will only become tradable once the project team makes a decision to enable circulation. Users should ensure they are informed about and comfortable with this lock-up period before participating. Please see these FAQs for more information.
