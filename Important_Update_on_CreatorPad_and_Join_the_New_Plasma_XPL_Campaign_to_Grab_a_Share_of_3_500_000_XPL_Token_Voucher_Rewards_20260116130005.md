Fellow Binancians,

Important Update on CreatorPad’s Point System

CreatorPad rewards users for creating and sharing insightful content on Binance Square about crypto projects and trends. Based on community feedback, we will be implementing a few changes starting with the Plasma campaign. 

Key updates include:

Quality over quantity: We will reduce the post quantity and trade requirements to focus more on semantic relevance, encouraging higher-quality content and creation. If you create valuable content, you can earn points more easily on Square.Weighted rewards: We will introduce weightage to reward genuine, high-quality, reputation-weighted interactions that quantify real influence and mindshare.We will add the interaction volume as a weighting factor, including comments, shares, likes, and total views.Merit-based and permissionless: Rewards will remain merit-based and permissionless, but only true contributors will earn rewards.

 These changes will be reflected in the leaderboard launching on 2026-01-23.
