Fellow Binancians,

Binance is pleased to announce that Soft Staking now supports five new tokens: Tron (TRX), Aptos (APT), IOTA (IOTA), ApeCoin (APE), and MultiversX (EGLD). Soft Staking allows users to earn staking rewards on selected tokens from their Spot Accounts, which can be simply activated with one click. Soft Staking offers full flexibility—users can trade, withdraw, or use their tokens anytime while earning rewards on their Spot assets.

How Binance Soft Staking Works: 

Soft Staking rewards are generated through the on-chain proof of stake mechanism and are paid out in the respective native token to users’ Spot Accounts daily.

Rewards are calculated based on the daily average balance of eligible tokens in users’ Spot Accounts. Users can refer to the Soft Staking Page and [Staking History] under [Staking] > [Soft Staking] to check the reward records.

After the addition of these 5 new tokens, Soft Staking now supports a total of 15 tokens, including BNB, SOL, TRX, ADA, SUI, TON, NEAR, APT, POL, ALGO, IOTA, S, APE, EGLD, and AXS. To qualify for Soft Staking rewards, users must meet the respective minimum holding requirement for each token in their Spot balance. There is also a cap on the eligible holding amount. Any balance above this cap will not earn additional rewards. For more details, visit the Soft Staking page.
