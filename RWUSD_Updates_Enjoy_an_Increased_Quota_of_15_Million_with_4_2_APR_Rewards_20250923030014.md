About RWUSD:

RWUSD is a principal-protected yield product that offers users flexible-term subscriptions with daily APR rewards. Designed to provide relatively stable returns, it aims to perform consistently in both rising and falling market conditions.

RWUSD is the record of your subscribed assets and any accrued rewards with Binance only. It is not a stablecoin, security, fund, tokenized RWA, or on-chain asset, and it does not represent any user right to any RWAs. Upon redemption, your RWUSD will be exchanged to USDC on a 1:1 basis (minus any applicable redemption fees). The APR is determined at Binance’s discretion and aims to benchmark yields in RWAs such as tokenized US Treasury Bills.
