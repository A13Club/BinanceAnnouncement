# Important Security Reminder for Projects: Stay Vigilant Against Fake Listing Agents and Scams

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians, 

At Binance, we are committed to fostering innovation and supporting high-quality projects in the blockchain ecosystem. As the largest crypto exchange by volume and users, our listing process is a key part of how we can help bring the most promising projects to our global user base, which is why we designed our listing process to be as rigorous, fair, and transparent as possible.

We are aware that bad actors frequently attempt to exploit the trusted name of Binance by falsely claiming to be Binance Business Development (BD) employees, official "listing agents," or intermediaries who can guarantee a listing on our platform for a fee. Such claims are a scam—listings are never guaranteed and Binance evaluates every project on their merits and takes into account factors such as community demand, market conditions, compliance, project viability and business model sustainability, and others.

To better protect your project and community, please read and adhere to the following three principles.

1. Zero Tolerance for Third-Party Intermediaries

Binance does not accept or recognize any third-party individual or agency to apply for a listing or negotiate on a project’s behalf.

Direct Communications Only: Binance engages with projects directly, and all listing applications and communications must come directly from the project's core team (e.g., Founder, Co-founders, C-levels). We will not engage with or grant any special consideration to applications submitted by external "consultants", “advisors” or "agents."Immediate Disqualification in the Event of Relying on Intermediaries: If Binance discovers that a project is using any third party to apply for a listing, the application will be immediately disqualified, and we will blacklist the applicant.

2. The Truth About Listing Fees & Token Payments

Binance does not charge a "listing fee" or any other fees for the platform itself. We aim to list and support promising projects to meet user demand, not to collect application fees. However, to ensure project commitment for user protection and to support marketing initiatives for our users’ benefits, we have structured agreements that include budget allocations for airdrops and other marketing campaigns to users.

Projects should understand the legitimate process for token transfers to protect themselves:

For Projects Launching on Binance Spot Market, including Direct Listing/HODLer Airdrops/Launchpool or Other Programs: Binance will only collect the agreed tokens after Binance makes an official announcement regarding the launch.For Binance Alpha and Binance Wallet, including Alpha Airdrop/Initial Alpha /Exclusive Binance Wallet TGE/Pre-TGE/Booster or other Programs: Binance will only collect the agreed tokens after a formal agreement has been fully executed, i.e., signed by both parties.Payment Details Verification: The wallet address, amount, and type of tokens requested must 100% match the details specified in the signed agreement. Any deviation is a clear red flag.If anyone—claiming to represent or be affiliated with Binance—requests payments in any form of fees or tokens before the conditions above are met, you are being targeted by a scam.Binance will not contact you by “official email” for listing matters or ask for “listing fees” in any channels. The following screenshot is an example of such a scam.

3. How to Verify Official Binance Communications and Employees

A crucial step in protecting yourself is knowing how to identify authentic Binance communications and personnel. To verify if someone is indeed from Binance, please follow these steps:

If you are contacted by someone claiming to represent Binance, you can cross-check their identity through our official verification portal Binance Verify by entering a URL, email address, phone number, Telegram handle, or social media account to check if the source is verified and officially from Binance.Report Suspicious Activity: If you are approached by a suspected scammer, please report it immediately to Binance Customer Support. Providing their contact details helps us protect the entire community.

Stay Vigilant

The security of your project and its assets is paramount. By understanding our official processes and remaining vigilant against these common scams, you can help us maintain a safe and trustworthy ecosystem for everyone.
