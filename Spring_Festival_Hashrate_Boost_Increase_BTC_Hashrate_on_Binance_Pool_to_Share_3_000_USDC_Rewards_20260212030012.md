Promotion Period: 2026-02-12 04:00 (UTC) to 2026-03-15 23:59 (UTC)

During the Promotion Period, eligible Binance Pool users can complete the following steps to participate:

Complete identity verification (KYC).Create a Binance Pool mining account (or use your existing account) and mine BTC Binance Pool.Increase your average BTC hashrate compared to your baseline period*.Eligible users will be ranked by Hashrate Gain within their respective groups. 

Refer to the BTC mining FAQ and the Activity Terms below for more information.

This Promotion is open to all eligible Binance Pool users who mine BTC during the Promotion Period, including existing and new users.

Hashrate Gain Calculation:

Hashrate gain is calculated based on each eligible user’s average hashrate:Campaign Average Hashrate: The user’s average BTC hashrate during the Promotion Period.Baseline Average Hashrate: The user’s average BTC hashrate from 2026-02-01 00:00 (UTC) to 2026-02-11 23:59 (UTC).Hashrate Gain (TH/s) = Campaign Average Hashrate − Baseline Average Hashrate*If a user had no BTC hashrate during the baseline period, their Baseline Average Hashrate will be treated as 0.

Reward Groups and Distribution

​​Eligible users will be placed into a reward group based on their Hashrate Gain (TH/s) during the Promotion Period. Within each group, the top 5 users with the highest Hashrate Gain during the Promotion Period will receive rewards:

GroupIndividual Hashrate Gain During Promotion Period (TH/S)Rewards per Eligible User (Top 5 in each group)1100 < Individual Hashrate Gain ≤ 50025 USDC each2500 < Individual Hashrate Gain ≤ 1,00050 USDC each31,000 < Individual Hashrate Gain ≤ 5,000100 USDC each45,000 < Individual Hashrate Gain ≤ 10,000175 USDC each5> 10,000250 USDC each

*If two or more users have the same Hashrate Gain within a group, rankings will be determined by the higher campaign average hashrate.

Reward Calculation Example:

User A mined on Binance Pool during the baseline period with an average hashrate of 200 TH/s.During the Promotion Period, User A mines with an average total hashrate of 900 TH/s.User A’s Hashrate Gain is: 900 TH/s − 200 TH/s = 700 TH/s.User A is therefore placed into Group 2 (500–1,000 TH/s gain) and will be ranked against other eligible users in that group. If User A ranks in the Top 5 of Group 2, User A will receive 50 USDC.
