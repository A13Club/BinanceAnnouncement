Terms & Conditions:

Only users who confirm participation on the campaign page and complete account verification will be eligible for rewards from the Promotions.The Promotions are only available to users who are enabled to use Binance Loans (Flexible Rates), and may not be available or may be restricted in certain jurisdictions or regions, or to certain users, depending on legal and regulatory requirements. Terms and Conditions for Binance Flexible Rate Loan apply.Promotions A and B:Only new Binance Loans (Flexible Rate) order(s) applied during the Promotion Period are eligible. Any repayment amount made by a user in respect of a Binance Loans (Flexible Rate) order made during the Promotion Period will be subtracted from the eligible loan amount when it comes to eligibility and rewards calculation.* Net Daily Average Loan Amount Formula: (Sum of eligible newly borrowed Loan orders -  repayment amount during the Promotion Period) / 31 days - [Sum of eligible newly borrowed Loan orders -  repayment amount from 2025-07-15 00:00 (UTC) to 2025-08-14 23:59 (UTC)] / 31 days. Case Study:User A borrowed 1,500 USDC on 2025-08-15, and maintained the 1,500 USDC borrowing until 2025-09-14, given that User A never used Flexible Rate Loan, the Net Daily Average Loan Amount will be 1,500 USDC, which is above $1,000 equivalent. User A is eligible to participate in Promotion B.User B borrowed 100,000 USDC on 2025-08-15, and repaid the 90,000 USDC borrowing on 2025-08-17, the daily average loan amount will be (100,000 * 2 + 10,000 * 29) / 31 = 15,806 USDC. However, User B’s daily average loan amount between 2025-07-15 to 2025-08-14 is 15,000 USDC. Thus, user B is not eligible for both Promotions since the Net Daily Average Loan Amount is 806 USDC, which is below $1,000 equivalent.User C borrowed 800,000 USDC on 2025-08-26, and repaid the 500,000 USDC borrowing on 2025-08-28, given the daily average loan amount will be (800,000 * 2 + 300,000 * 18) / 31 = 225,806 USDC. Since User C’s daily average loan amount between 2025-07-15 to 2025-08-14 is 75,000 USDC, the Net Daily Average Loan Amount is 150,806 USDC. However, User C is ranked 800th, therefore User C is not eligible for the Promotion A’s reward but is eligible to participate in Promotion B.User D borrowed 299,000 USDC on 2025-08-15, and maintained the 299,000 USDC borrowing until 2025-09-14, given that User D never used Flexible Rate Loan, the Net Daily Average Loan Amount will be 299,000 USDC and ranked 290 under ≥ $300,000 net loan volume threshold. User D will receive 66 USDC from Promotion A and is eligible to participate in Promotion B as well. If Promotion A’s eligible users have the same Net Daily Average Loan Amount, we will use the BNB Smart Chain hash value at 2025-09-14 23:59 (UTC) to automatically select eligible users with the most consecutive numerical digits in their UID to be the winners. Eligible users from Promotion A can only receive rewards from one loan volume threshold tier based on the Net Daily Average Loan Amount. However, if the user does not make it to any qualifying rank of that threshold, they will not receive any rewards.Rewards:The USDC rewards from Promotion A will be distributed to eligible users' Spot Accounts within four (4) weeks after the Promotions end.Promotions A and B are not mutually exclusive, participants of Promotion A are also eligible to receive rewards in Promotion B if they meet the conditions.Users who receive token voucher rewards in Promotion B can view and redeem them in the Reward Hub.Token voucher winners must activate their vouchers within 14 days after the reward is issued, otherwise they will expire.
