# Binance Launches Indication of Interest

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region. Terms and conditions will apply to the Promotion. 

Fellow Binancians,

Binance OTC & Execution Services is excited to launch Indication of Interest (IOI), the latest enhancement to our suite of VIP & Institutional tools. This new function allows users to privately signal buy or sell interest (Spot IOI) as well as borrowing or lending intentions (Loan IOI).

To complement the launch of Binance IOI, we are offering Binance VIPs exclusive rewards to borrow assets via the Loan IOI feature.

About Indication of Interest

An Indication of Interest (IOI) is a private, non-binding expression of intent to trade a specific asset. In traditional finance, IOIs are widely used to help traders gauge market interest and potential liquidity without making a firm commitment. They are especially valuable for sizable or sensitive transactions.

On Binance, the IOI feature is divided into two core functions: Spot IOI and Loan IOI.

Spot IOI

Spot IOI allows traders to express buy or sell interest for a specific asset at a targeted price level. By submitting a Spot IOI, you communicate your intent directly to our OTC trading desk, which will actively work to match your order with a counterparty through the industry’s largest network of liquidity providers.

Loan IOI

Loan IOI is an alternative, bespoke solution for yield generation and liquidity management by allowing users to set custom loan terms as borrowers or lenders, which our OTC trading desk then matches with interested counterparties.

Benefits of Indication of Interest

Private Signaling: Block traders use IOIs to discreetly communicate trade interests with the OTC team, avoiding exposure to the broader market, minimizing unwanted attention, and reducing the risk of reactive quote reposting.Early Liquidity Identification: IOIs helps you gauge buyer or seller interest at your desired price and size. Confirming a counterparty allows you to pursue better pricing with confidence, while a lack of response allows you to promptly adjust your strategy. Improved Trade Matching: IOIs provide a discreet way to review terms, size, and price, especially for less liquid assets. You can pause unfavorable trades or keep IOIs active to attract better offers.Capital Flexibility and Efficiency: For users and institutions facing capital inefficiencies from idle funds or limited liquidity. Loan IOIs offers flexible, customizable loan amounts, rates, and durations to fit your needs.
