Fellow Binancians, 

Binance is excited to launch two exclusive events for Reveel within the Binance Wallet:

Pre-TGE: Eligible users can subscribe to REVA token from Reveel, before it becomes tradable.Booster Program: Share additional 40,000,000 REVA airdrops by completing phased tasks and supporting the project during its early development phase.

Reveel Pre-TGE 

During the Pre-TGE event, users can subscribe to the REVA token from Reveel, exclusively within the Binance Wallet. The subscription process follows an over-subscription model, allowing up to 3 BNB deposits per user. Token allocation is proportional to the total BNB deposited by all participants. After the subscription period ends, users can claim their REVA tokens via the [Assets] tab, and the unused BNB will be automatically refunded. Important: As this is a Pre-TGE event, REVA tokens claimed through this event are subject to a mandatory lock-up period and will not be immediately tradable. Tokens will only become tradable once the project team makes a decision to enable circulation. Users should ensure they are informed about and comfortable with this lock-up period before participating. Please see these FAQs for more information.
