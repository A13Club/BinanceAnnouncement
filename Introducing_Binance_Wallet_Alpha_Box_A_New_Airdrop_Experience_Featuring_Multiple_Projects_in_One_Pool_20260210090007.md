# Introducing Binance Wallet Alpha Box: A New Airdrop Experience Featuring Multiple Projects in One Pool

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance Wallet is excited to introduce the Alpha Box, a new airdrop mechanism that brings multiple projects together in a single event. Building on our popular Binance Alpha airdrops, the Alpha Box allows users to participate for a chance to receive tokens from one of several partner projects.

What Is the Alpha Box:

The Alpha Box is a new airdrop model pioneered by Binance, where multiple projects each pool their tokens to a single event. Users can participate by redeeming their Binance Alpha Points for an Alpha Box airdrop, and receive tokens of equivalent value from one of the featured projects in the box. Additionally, an Alpha Box may include projects that have previously debuted on Binance Alpha, giving users a second chance to participate in these early-stage projects.

The First Alpha Box Event:

The first Alpha Box event will begin on 2026-02-11. Tokens featured in this event, along with participation details, such as the Alpha Points threshold, will be announced on 2026-02-11 on the official Binance Wallet X account. Participation is on a first-come, first-served basis until the airdrop pool is fully distributed. The points threshold will automatically decrease by 5 points every 5 minutes until all available rewards have been fully claimed.
