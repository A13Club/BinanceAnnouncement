This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians, 

To protect users and maintain a high quality trading market, Binance conducts periodic reviews of all listed spot trading pairs, and may delist selected spot trading pairs due to multiple factors, such as poor liquidity and trading volume.

Based on our most recent reviews, Binance will remove and cease trading on the following spot trading pairs:

At 2025-08-15 03:00 (UTC): ANIME/FDUSD, HYPER/FDUSD and STO/BNB

Please Note:

The delisting of a spot trading pair does not affect the availability of the tokens on Binance Spot. Users can still trade the spot trading pairâ€™s base and quote assets on other trading pair(s) that are available on Binance. 

Binance will terminate Spot Trading Bots services for the aforementioned spot trading pairs at 2025-08-15 03:00 (UTC) where applicable. Users are strongly advised to update and/or cancel their Spot Trading Bots prior to the cessation of Spot Trading Bots services to avoid any potential losses.There may be discrepancies between this original content in English and any translated versions.
