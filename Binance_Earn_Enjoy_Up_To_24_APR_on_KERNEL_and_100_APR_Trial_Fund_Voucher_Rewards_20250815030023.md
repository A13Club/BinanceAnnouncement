Go to Reward Hub to check the “KERNEL Trial Fund Voucher”. Click “Use” on the voucher before the expiration date, which is set at 14 days upon receiving the voucher.Interest Rewards Distribution: You will start receiving the APR rewards in your Spot Account two days after the voucher is used. Check the rewards in your Earn Account.

Interest Rewards will be calculated based on the formula: Face Value * APR * (Duration / 365)For example, user A uses a 100% APR Trial Fund Voucher for 5-day Interest Rewards on 500 KERNEL. The total rewards user A can gain is: 500 * 100% * (5 / 365) = 6.8493150685 KERNEL
