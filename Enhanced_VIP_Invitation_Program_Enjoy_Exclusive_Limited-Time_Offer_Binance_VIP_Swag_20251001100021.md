This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance is thrilled to present the updated VIP Invitation Program. Users who newly join the Binance VIP Invitation Program can enjoy VIP level upgrades based on their trading volume or asset holdings from other exchanges.

Eligible users will receive a VIP+1 level upgrade for 2 months upon successful entry to the program, and may qualify for VIP upgrade extension benefit by meeting select requirements. 

Key Updates

In addition to trading volume proof, asset holding from other platforms will also be counted in the invitation program. For more information on the criteria, please refer to Path A under the VIP Holder Program. Users whose 30-day Spot or Futures trading volume on Binance reaches at least 70% of the trading volumes requirement for their VIP+1 level in the last week of their two-month upgrade period, will be granted an additional month at the same VIP+1 level.
