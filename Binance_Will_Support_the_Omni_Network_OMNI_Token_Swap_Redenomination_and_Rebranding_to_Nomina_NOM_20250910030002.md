The aforementioned contract(s) will be removed after the settlement is complete. Users are advised to close any open positions prior to the settlement time to avoid automatic settlement. Binance Funding Rate Arbitrage Bot will close all arbitrage strategies and conduct an automatic settlement on the OMNIUSDT symbol(s).During the final hour proceeding the scheduled settlement time of a futures contract, the Futures Insurance Fund will not be utilised to support the liquidation process in respect of that futures contract.

If, following the execution of the IOCO, the assets remaining available in the user's account are sufficient to meet the required Maintenance Margin (after accounting for realized losses and any applicable Liquidation Clearance Fee), the liquidation will cease. If the IOCO fails to fully reduce the position to a level that satisfies the Margin Maintenance requirements, any unfilled portion of the position will be resolved through the Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) process. Users are strongly advised to actively monitor and manage open positions during the final hour, as this period may be subject to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity.In order to protect users and prevent potential risks in extremely volatile market conditions, Binance Futures may undertake additional protective measures toward the aforementioned contract(s) without further announcements, including but not limited to adjusting the maximum leverage value, position value, and maintenance margin in each margin tier, updating funding rates, such as the interest rate, premium and capped funding rate, changing the constituents of the price index, and using the Last Price Protected mechanism to update the Mark Price.
