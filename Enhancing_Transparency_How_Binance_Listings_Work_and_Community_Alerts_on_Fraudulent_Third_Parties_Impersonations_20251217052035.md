This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Binance remains committed to fostering a transparent and structured listing framework that encourages innovation while prioritizing user protection, regulatory compliance, and long-term project quality.

This announcement outlines Binance’s various listing options. By clearly explaining these pathways and requirements, we aim to help projects better understand how to engage with Binance’s listing ecosystem and to provide users with confidence in the quality and legitimacy of listed assets.

For projects interested in listing on Binance, detailed application instructions and important security reminders are provided at the end of this announcement.

Overview of Binance Listing Alternatives and Choosing A Suitable Listing Path:

Binance offers multiple listing options tailored to different stages and needs of projects. 

Binance Alpha is a pre-listing token selection platform dedicated to discovering promising early-stage crypto projects within the Web3 ecosystem, offering token distribution opportunities such as Pre-Token Generation Events (Pre-TGE), Prime Sale Pre-TGEs, Token Generation Events (TGE), Alpha Airdrops, as well as community engagement programs like Booster to help projects build momentum before official listing.Binance Futures is the world’s largest crypto futures platform by trading volume. Users can use futures and other derivatives for liquidity, express their view on the market, as well as hedge their portfolios and protect against unexpected market movements. Derivatives allow users to take on long and short positions without holding the underlying tokens.Binance Spot is the world’s largest crypto spot platform by trading volume, allowing users to directly buy, sell, and hold high-quality crypto assets, facilitating asset ownership and long-term holding. Beyond direct spot listings, Binance offers multiple opportunities for projects to increase exposure and user engagement, including HODLer Airdrops, Launchpool, and Megadrop. 

These initiatives help projects gain early traction by engaging Binance’s large user base, while users can access tokens before their official spot listing.

To help projects navigate the most suitable listing path, the following table categorizes projects based on both their token status and lifecycle stage, ranging from early-stage to mature, well-established tokens. Each combination aligns with different listing products that best match the project’s current development phase, token readiness, and market potential.

Listing Requirements and the Upgrade Process:

Binance follows a structured listing process across three stages: Binance Alpha, Binance Futures, and Binance Spot. This progression allows a careful evaluation of each project’s performance and potential at every step. 

Binance Alpha serves as an initial stage where promising projects are introduced to the community.Projects that demonstrate strong performance and meet key criteria may be listed on Binance Futures, expanding trading opportunities with perpetual contracts.Projects that satisfy the necessary criteria may be directly listed or promoted to Binance Spot, unlocking full market access and liquidity.

This staged approach helps promote the progression of high-quality projects, aiming to provide users with confidence and projects with a pathway to greater market exposure. 

The progression from one stage to the next is based on a comprehensive evaluation of factors, such as project fundamentals, secondary market metrics, user engagement, and compliance standards. While the evaluation is holistic, the following key areas are generally assessed (this list is not exhaustive):

Product QualityProduct Real TractionUtilityUser MetricsBusiness and Revenue ModelGrowth PotentialTokenomicsTeam BackgroundTechnical Risk AssessmentCompliance and Regulatory ReviewUser Protection 

For projects with tokens already circulating in the market, additional factors such as performance, trading volume, valuation, liquidity, and token distribution are also taken into account during the evaluation process. 

In all cases, Binance will assess tokens in compliance with its regulatory obligations. 

In some instances, projects may be offered a Futures listing at the point of Alpha Featuring. This could be contingent on the project’s fundamentals, secondary market metrics, compliance with market rules, and other factors. Futures listing is only implemented with the cooperation of the project team, but the final decision to list will be made at Binance’s sole evaluation and discretion.

Community Alert: Beware of Fraudulent Third Parties Impersonating Binance

We have observed a significant increase in scam attempts where bad actors falsely present themselves as Binance employees (including Business Development staff), official “listing agents,” or authorized intermediaries. They often promise guaranteed listing outcomes in exchange for fees. These claims are entirely fraudulent. No listing is ever guaranteed, and Binance does not charge any fee for project evaluations or listing applications.

To safeguard your project and community, please strictly adhere to the following principles:

Binance Does Not Endorse or Recognize Any Third-Party IntermediariesBinance does not appoint, accept, or endorse any individual or agency to apply for a listing or negotiate on behalf of a project. Any party claiming to represent Binance in exchange for payment is fraudulent.Direct Communication OnlyAll listing-related communication must come directly from the project’s core team (e.g., Founders, Co-founders, C-level executives). We do not engage with or grant special consideration to applications submitted through external “consultants,” “advisors,” or “agents.” All members of the Binance Listing communication group must be part of the core team, submit their KYC information, and disclose their identity.Immediate Disqualification for Use of IntermediariesIf Binance discovers that a project has used a third party to apply for a listing, the application will be immediately disqualified, and the project will be blacklisted from future applications. Project teams that proactively report intermediaries or middlemen and provide valid leads will be given priority review.

Blacklisted by Binance Internal Audit:

Binance has received reports about certain individuals and entities falsely claiming to be “Binance listing agents” or offering to secure token listings on Binance in exchange for payment. Please exercise caution and remember that Binance does not authorize anyone to offer such services. The following are on Binance’s blacklist (this list is not exhaustive):

Our Commitment to Action:

Binance will take strong measures, including legal action, against fraudulent brokers identified through reports. We maintain a dedicated channel for reporting fraudulent activities. If you are contacted by any party claiming to be a Binance employee, affiliate, or representative—soliciting fees for trading support, listing assistance, or any other form of compensation—please report it to us immediately. We offer a bounty of up to $5 million to whistleblowers who provide valid information.

How to Report:

We value and encourage ongoing community oversight. Anyone with credible information—including parties who receive or come across information relating to middlemen, intermediaries, agents, or solicitation requests—is urged to carefully document and preserve any relevant evidence, such as screenshots, audio recordings, or other supporting materials, and report it through our official whistleblowing channel at audit@binance.com.

Critical Reminder:

No legitimate Binance representative will ever solicit payment for listing services. If you are approached by any individual or group requesting payment in connection with a Binance listing, it is a scam. Do not engage, and do not transfer any funds.

Stay vigilant and always verify communications through our official channels. Protect your project by dealing directly with Binance.
