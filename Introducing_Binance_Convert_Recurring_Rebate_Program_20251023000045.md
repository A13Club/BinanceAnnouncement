The program offers tiered rebates based on the user’s monthly recurring investment amount (as low as $1) and the length of their investment plan’s streak.

Minimum Streak: 1 (on per plan level);Minimum Monthly Recurring Investment: $1 per plan

Bonus Reward for New-to-Recurring Users:

New-to-Recurring users* can earn an extra 2 USDC reward when they subscribe to a new Convert Recurring plan with a minimum monthly amount of $20 or equivalent.

Note: *New-to-Recurring users refer to users who have not used Binance Convert Recurring prior to 2025-10-23 00:00 (UTC), have registered for a Binance account, completed KYC and completed their first trade on Binance via Binance Convert Recurring.

How to Receive Rewards:

The rebate amount will be credited on a monthly basis to each user’s spot account in USDC tokens, within 3 weeks after the last day of each calendar month.

Rebate calculations are calculated at the individual plan level, based on the accumulated plan value (USD equivalent) per plan in each calendar month.

The calculation of streak for each plan ends on the last day of the calendar month. A user’s streak in a given month is based on the number of consecutive previous months (counting backwards from the month immediately before) in which the user had at least one valid transaction.Streak = 1, users had ≥1 transaction in the previous monthStreak = 2, users had ≥1 transaction in each of the last 2 consecutive monthsStreak = 3, user had ≥1 transaction in each of the last 3 consecutive months

Case Examples:

User A has 2 existing plans (A, B) and 1 new plan (C) set up on 2025-10-20.

Notes:

The new plan (C) in the case example will not qualify for the bonus new-to-recurring reward because it is not the first ever recurring plan that User A has subscribed with Binance Convert.Plans cannot be combined to meet the minimum requirements, only standalone plans that meet the full criteria of each month will qualify.Plans must remain active for the full period of calendar month to be eligible for rebate in the same month. Cancelled plans are not eligible.Existing Recurring Plans that are ongoing/active with minimal streak of 1 as of 2025-11-01 will also qualify if they meet the above criteria.
