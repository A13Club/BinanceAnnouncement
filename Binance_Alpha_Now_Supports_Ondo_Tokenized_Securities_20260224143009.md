What Are Tokenized Securities:

Tokenized Securities are digital securities designed to track the price performance of traditional stocks or ETFs on-chain. While they provide exposure to the price movements of the underlying asset, they do not grant all shareholder rights, such as voting rights. 

Ondo Tokenized Securities are provided by Ondo, a blockchain-based platform focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), such as securities and ETFs. 

Ondo Tokenized Securities are classified as Securities (Structured Products) under FSRA regulations and are made available to users via Binance Alpha. For more information, please refer to the Admission to Trading Notices here.
