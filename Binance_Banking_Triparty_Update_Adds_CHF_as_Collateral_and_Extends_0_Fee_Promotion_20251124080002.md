This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance is excited to announce several enhancements to the Binance Banking Triparty solution, designed to provide our institutional and VIP users with greater flexibility and capital efficiency.

Key Updates:

New Collateral Assets: Effective from 2025-11-24, Binance will accept Swiss Franc (CHF) as an eligible collateral asset that users can hold off-exchange via the triparty solution. This follows Binance’s recent announcement to support BlackRock’s BUIDL token as off-exchange collateral.0% Fee Promotion Extension: The popular zero-fee promotion for Banking Triparty clients is now extended until 2026-03-31, giving institutions the opportunity to explore the product with minimal friction and no platform costs on pledged funds.

What Is Banking Triparty:

In November 2023, Binance became the first crypto exchange to pilot a Banking Triparty arrangement, a high-trust custody framework built for institutions that follows traditional financial (TradFi) standards. 

The solution allows Binance users to hold traditional collateral — such as fiat currency and Treasury Bills — off-exchange, in their own corporate account, with a regulated third-party bank. While these assets remain securely safeguarded with the banking partner, users have access to corresponding liquidity on-exchange that enables them to trade on Binance without moving their collateral.

Type of Partners Involved:

The Banking Triparty arrangement involves a collaboration between three key parties: 

The client (our VIP or Institutional user)Binance (the exchange providing liquidity and trading execution)And a regulated third-party banking partner that holds the collateral in a segregated account under the client's name. 

The Importance of the Triparty Model in Crypto:

This structure helps manage counterparty risk and mirrors a setup widely used in traditional financial markets. By separating custody from execution, institutions can better align their crypto activity with internal risk mandates and operational policies. For institutions seeking secure, capital-efficient exposure to crypto, Banking Triparty offers a model that combines TradFi-grade custody with Binance-grade liquidity.

0% Fee Promotion Extended Until 2026-03-31:

To support broader institutional access, Binance is extending its popular zero-fee promotion. All service fees on pledged funds are waived for Banking Triparty clients until 2026-03-31. This offers a limited-time opportunity for institutions to explore the product with minimal friction and no platform costs on pledged funds. 

From April 2026, a new tiered pricing model will apply, with competitive rates that support long-term adoption and reflect the improved cost efficiency.
