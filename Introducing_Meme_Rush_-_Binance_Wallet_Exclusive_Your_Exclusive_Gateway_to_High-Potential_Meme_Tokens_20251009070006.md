Fellow Binancians,

Binance Wallet is excited to introduce Meme Rush – Binance Wallet Exclusive, a feature designed specifically for Binance Wallet (Keyless) users to discover and participate in meme token projects. Partnering with Four.Meme, a leading meme launchpad, Meme Rush offers fair and structured token mechanics and a dynamic ranking to track token performance, enabling users to participate confidently through a seamless integration of the Four.Meme’s token launch platform technology.

Highlights

Exclusive Access for Binance Wallet (Keyless) users: Verified users can participate in meme token launches at the earliest stages, engaging in a fair, secure, and transparent environment.Structured Token Lifecycle: Tokens advance through New and Finalizing Stages using a bonding curve model, followed by migration to a decentralized exchange (DEX). Performance is fully visible on the Meme Rank, and high-performing tokens may potentially be made available for trading on Binance Alpha, subject to fulfilling Binance Alpha’s features requirements.Opportunities for Projects: Participating projects gain exposure to an active community, transparent visibility on Binance Wallet and the Migrated Tokens Ranking, as well as strategic positioning within an environment that fosters credibility and growth.4x Alpha Trading Volume Boost: Users earn 4x trading volume on all Meme Rush tokens during the Meme Rush Stages, and for 30 days after the token is featured on Binance Alpha (if eligible). 

How It Works

Tokens on Meme Rush - Binance Wallet Exclusive are available via the Meme Rush tab on App or Web, which seamlessly integrates existing mechanics of Four.Meme for token launches. During the New and Finalizing Stages, tokens are exclusively accessible to Binance Wallet (Keyless) users. Each token progresses through a structured lifecycle to ensure fair access, transparency, and orderly market introduction:

1. New Stage

During the New Stage, early adopters on Binance Wallet may purchase tokens while supply and price follow a bonding curve model. Tokens are non-transferable, and all transactions are supported by a virtual liquidity pool to ensure smooth execution.

Trading: Limited to Binance Wallet (Keyless) users only.Transfer: Non-transferable.Liquidity: Supported by a virtual liquidity pool.

2. Finalizing Stage

In the Finalizing Stage, the bonding curve mechanics continue as tokens prepare for migration. Binance Wallet (Keyless) users may continue to participate in token trading. Tokens remain non-transferable, with the virtual liquidity pool continuing to support seamless transactions.

Trading: Limited to Binance Wallet (Keyless) users only.Transfer: Non-transferable.Liquidity: Virtual liquidity pool continues to facilitate transactions.

3. Migrated Stage

Tokens enter the Migrated Stage if they reach certain milestones, starting with a $1M FDV at launch. Thresholds may be dynamically adjusted at Binance Wallet’s discretion based on market conditions and user feedback, with any changes announced to the community. At this stage, liquidity is transferred to a decentralized exchange (DEX), and tokens become fully transferable. Tokens also appear on the Binance Wallet Migrated Tokens Ranking, providing complete performance visibility.

Trading: Open to both Binance Wallet and non-Binance Wallet users.Transfer: Fully transferable.Liquidity: Migrated to a DEX after reaching milestones.Ranking: Full visibility on Binance Migrated Tokens Ranking.

Note: High-performing tokens may be considered for future Binance Alpha opportunities.

For all tokens launched via Meme Rush - Binance Wallet Exclusive, trading volume generated on Binance Wallet (Keyless) during token purchase from creation until 30 days after being featured on Binance Alpha will be counted as 4x trading volume for Binance Alpha points, if tokens pass Binance Alpha’s evaluation.
