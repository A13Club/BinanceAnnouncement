This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance constantly reviews its product and service offerings to ensure the best user experience for all users. Effective from 2026-01-02 12:00 (UTC), if the funding rate of USDⓈ-M perpetual contracts with funding rate settlement frequency of every one hour is less than or equal to the absolute value of 0.025% for 16 consecutive cycles, Binance Futures will revert the settlement frequency from every one hour to every four hours on the 17th cycle. 

Example:

The funding rate settlement frequency of ZKPUSDT USDⓈ-M Perpetual Contract will be adjusted from every one hour to every four hours latest by 2026-01-02 12:15 (UTC) if the funding rate is less than or equal to the absolute value of 0.025% starting from 2026-01-01 21:00 (UTC) to 2026-01-02 14:00 (UTC) consecutively (every hour).  Thus, the upcoming funding payment with a settlement frequency of every four hours after the adjustment will occur at 2026-01-02 16:00 (UTC). The detailed arrangement is as follows:

TimeMax Funding Rate2026-01-02 11:00 (UTC)+2.00% / -2.00%2026-01-02 12:00 (UTC)+2.00% / -2.00%2026-01-02 16:00 (UTC)+2.00% / -2.00%2026-01-02 20:00 (UTC)+2.00% / -2.00%……

The funding rate settlement frequency of ZKPUSDT USDⓈ-M Perpetual Contract will not be adjusted from every one hour to every four hours if the funding rate is more than the absolute value of 0.025% in any cycles between  2026-01-01 21:00 (UTC) to 2026-01-02 14:00 (UTC) . 

Notes

The adjustment will be completed within approximately 15 minutes after the aforementioned conditions are fulfilled. For example, when the funding rate settlement frequency should be updated from every one hour to every four hours at 08:00 (UTC) funding rate settlement, users will see the adjustment on the funding rate settlement frequency latest by 08:15 (UTC). A separate announcement will be made if Binance Futures decides to adjust the parameters of the aforementioned conditions. Please note that funding payments with a settlement frequency of every four hours occur at 00:00 (UTC), 04:00 (UTC), 08:00 (UTC), 12:00 (UTC), 16:00 (UTC) and 20:00 (UTC).Users may visit the Real-Time Funding Rate and Funding Rate History pages to view the latest funding interval and historical funding rates.
