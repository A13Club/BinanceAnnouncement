About Secure Auto Sign:

Secure Auto Sign enables fast and convenient transaction signing for Limit Orders, allowing users to place and manage orders more efficiently without repeated manual approvals. 

It operates within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): a secure and isolated hardware environment, ensuring private keys remain protected while users retain full self-custody. This gives users the flexibility to automate trading actions securely, without sacrificing control or security.

Key characteristics include:

Convenient and fast signing: Allows users to authorize transactions quickly and seamlessly, improving the trading experience without compromising control over private keys.Secure Isolation: Signing occurs in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), which ensures that only wallet owners can delegate signing rights. No one (including Binance or the hardware provider) can access private keys or execute unauthorized actions.Verifiable Self-custody: The system supports third-party verification to prove that private key isolation and transaction delegation remain intact, preserving user self-custody at all times.

Why Trade on Desktop?

Binance Wallet (Web) was introduced to address desktop-specific needs. It offers more screen space, modular layouts, and faster multitasking for on-chain users who trade actively or monitor multiple signals. While the mobile app excels in portability, Binance Wallet (Web)  enables plugin-free, browser-native trading with floating widgets and real-time data panels, all on one page. It is ideal for meme coin discovery, wallet tracking, and strategy execution without tab switching.
