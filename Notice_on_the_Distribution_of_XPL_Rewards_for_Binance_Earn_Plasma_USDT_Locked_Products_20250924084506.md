This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Following Plasma’s recent Token Generation Event (TGE) and the launch of our Plasma USDT Locked Product on Binance Earn On-Chain Yields, Binance is pleased to announce the XPL Rewards Distribution details for all eligible Plasma USDT Locked Product users. 

With the positive feedback from our community, Binance is working on an upgrade for our Plasma USDT Locked Product. More details will be announced separately at a later date. In the meantime, stay subscribed to the Plasma USDT Locked Product!

About XPL Rewards:

Total XPL Rewards: 100,000,000 XPL (1% of Total Token Supply)Reward Calculation: Similar to the snapshot methods mentioned at launch, Binance will take multiple daily snapshots of each user’s USDT subscription amount and the total subscription pool of the product at any point of time, and calculate the final reward distribution based on all historical snapshots. Please refer to the FAQ for more information.Snapshot Details: Snapshots are taken daily of users’ positions from 2025-08-20 to 2025-09-24 (a total of 36 days) to calculate XPL Rewards.Each snapshot records user holdings as of the previous day (e.g., a T+1 delay after any subscription or redemption) to ensure accuracy. Consequently, rewards begin accruing one day after subscription, and redemptions are reflected starting the day after they occur.Each user's reward is calculated as a proportion of their average holding relative to the total average holdings of the entire pool across all users during the snapshot period.No further snapshots or XPL Rewards are accumulated after the distribution. However, stay subscribed with Plasma USDT Locked Product to ensure you stay updated on the latest rewards and news.

About XPL Airdrop Distribution:

Reward Distribution: From 2025-09-25, XPL rewards will be airdropped to eligible users' Spot Accounts that were subscribed to the product. No action is required from users. Users can confirm the receipt of the airdrop via Assets > Overview > History > Distribution.
