About DeFi BNSOL Assets:

To enhance the BNSOL ecosystem further, Binance has extended BNSOL benefits from the exchange to the DeFi space with the new DeFi BNSOL Assets feature. For this BNSOL Super Stake, DeFi BNSOL Assets (see table above) will be supported in APR Boost Airdrop Rewards calculation. If users hold the supported DeFi BNSOL assets in their Binance Wallet (Keyless only)*, these assets will also be counted towards their BNSOL Super Stake holdings for APR Boost Airdrop Rewards.Please note that from 2025-08-05 onwards, new DeFi BNSOL Asset added to the above list will also start receiving APR Boost Airdrop Rewards from other active and announced BNSOL Super Stake campaigns after the first day’s snapshot.

About BNSOL:

Binance Staked SOL (BNSOL) represents your staked SOL plus the staking rewards received, in a tradable and transferable form. Ordinary staking would lock up your staked assets, which means you cannot use them for other purposes. In contrast, BNSOL provides flexibility to sell, transfer, or use the staked SOL position. You can even move BNSOL to a personal wallet, such as Binance Wallet and use it outside the Binance platform whilst still earning rewards. BNSOL accumulates staking rewards through the BNSOL:SOL conversion rate, even when it is used in other Binance products or external DeFi applications for additional yield opportunities.
