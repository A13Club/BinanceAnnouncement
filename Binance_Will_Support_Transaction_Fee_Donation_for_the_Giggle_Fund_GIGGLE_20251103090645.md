# Binance Will Support Transaction Fee Donation for the Giggle Fund (GIGGLE)

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region. 

Fellow Binancians,

Starting December 2025, Binance will donate 50% of the transaction fees generated from Giggle Fund (GIGGLE) Spot and Margin trading to support charitable projects championed by Giggle Fund. Giggle Fund is a charity-focused memecoin on BNB Smart Chain that converts trading fees into donations for children’s education via Giggle Academy. This donation plan enables users who trade GIGGLE to participate towards meaningful social impact powered by crypto innovation.

Giggle Fund is a community-driven initiative that supports educational causes and is not officially associated with Giggle Academy. This donation plan does not constitute investment support for any token or project, and Binance will maintain a neutral stance, ensuring transparent and accountable dissemination of charitable funds.

Validity Period: 2025-11-01 00:00:00 (UTC) until further notice.

Binance will continue to work with the community to support the implementation of this new donation plan, and if for any reason this can’t be done, Binance will consider withdrawing the donation contribution going forward. This donation plan will not affect trading fees on GIGGLE Spot and Margin trading pairs.
