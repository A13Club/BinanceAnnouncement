Please note that in relation to Binance Alpha (i) the risk of loss of all or part of your investment is magnified with Binance Alpha assets as they are subject to increased price volatility (ii) by purchasing Alpha Assets, you are exposed to price slippage and blockchain fees, which can have a negative impact of the price of Alpha Assets (iii) Alpha Assets cannot be withdrawn from the Binance Exchange, and you will only be able to access Alpha Assets from your Alpha Account only.
