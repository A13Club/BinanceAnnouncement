Fellow Binancians,

Binance is excited to announce the 51st project on the HODLer Airdrops page – Euler (EUL), a DeFi Super App that unites lending and trading any asset as collateral, custom markets, and deep liquidity.

Users who subscribed their BNB to Simple Earn (Flexible and/or Locked) and/or On-Chain Yields products from 2025-10-04 00:00 (UTC) to 2025-10-06 23:59 (UTC) will get the airdrops distribution. The HODLer Airdrops information is estimated to be available in 24 hours, and the new token will be distributed to users’ Spot Accounts at least 1 hour before trading starts.

Binance will then list EUL at 2025-10-13 14:30 (UTC) and open trading against USDT, USDC, BNB, FDUSD, and TRY pairs. The seed tag will be applied to EUL. Users can start depositing EUL at 2025-10-13 10:30 (UTC). 

*Please note that users can now trade EUL on Binance Alpha Market. However, once spot trading opens, EUL will no longer be showcased on Binance Alpha, and its trading volume will no longer be counted towards Alpha Points.

Introducing Binance HODLer Airdrops

Binance HODLer Airdrops is a program that rewards BNB holders with token airdrops based on historical snapshots of their BNB balances. By subscribing BNB to Simple Earn, users are automatically eligible for HODLer Airdrops (as well as Launchpool and Megadrop rewards). By subscribing BNB to On-Chain Yields, users are automatically eligible for HODLer Airdrops and Launchpool rewards.

Unlike other earning methods that require ongoing actions, HODLer Airdrops reward users retroactively, offering a simple way to earn additional tokens. By subscribing BNB to Simple Earn products and/or On-Chain Yields, users can automatically qualify for token rewards.

How to Benefit from HODLer Airdrops

Head to [Earn] and search for BNB. Subscribe to Simple Earn (Flexible and/or Locked) and/or On-Chain Yields products with your BNB holdings.Snapshots of user balances and total pool balances will be taken multiple times at any point of time each hour to get users’ hourly average balances in Simple Earn (Flexible and/or Locked) and/or On-Chain Yields products. Binance will use historical snapshots of user balances at random periods after this announcement to calculate user rewards. For example, reward calculation for HODLer Airdrops on 2024-06-11 may use snapshots of user balances between 2024-06-01 to 2024-06-07 as reference.Eligible users will receive HODLer Airdrops rewards in their Spot Accounts within 24 hours after the HODLer Airdrops is announced.
