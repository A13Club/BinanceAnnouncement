About WBETH & BNSOL Collateral Price Index and Ratio:

As a reminder, Binance recently updated its product and service offerings to ensure the best user experience for all users: 

The Price Index Components for both WBETH and BNSOL have been updated to ensure more reliable price tracking for liquidations. The price index will rely on the official WBETH and BNSOL conversion ratios, shown on the respective ETH Staking and SOL Staking pages, without the impact of token spot market biased volatility. This ensures the index price more accurately reflects the underlying staked asset value - ETH and SOL.

About Binance ETH Staking (WBETH) & SOL Staking (BNSOL):

Binance ETH Staking (WBETH) allows users to stake their Ethereum (ETH) tokens to support the Ethereum network’s operations. By staking ETH on Binance, users contribute to the network’s security and efficiency, and will receive WBETH tokens in return (i.e., a tokenized representation of staked ETH and rewards). For more information on ETH Staking, please visit our ETH Staking page and FAQs.

Binance SOL Staking (BNSOL) represents your staked SOL plus the staking rewards received, in a tradable and transferable form. Ordinary staking would lock up your staked assets, which means you cannot use them for other purposes – it increases a user's opportunity cost. In contrast, BNSOL provides flexibility to sell, transfer, or use the staked SOL position. You can even move BNSOL to a personal wallet, such as Binance Wallet and use it outside the Binance platform whilst still earning rewards. BNSOL accumulates staking rewards through the BNSOL:SOL conversion rate, even when it is used in other Binance products or external DeFi applications for additional yield opportunities. For more information on SOL Staking, please visit our SOL Staking page and FAQs.
