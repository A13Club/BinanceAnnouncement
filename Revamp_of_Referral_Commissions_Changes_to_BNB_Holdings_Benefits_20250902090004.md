# Revamp of Referral Commissions: Changes to BNB Holdings Benefits

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

We are always looking for ways to enhance your experience on Binance. As part of this commitment, we are updating the Binance Referral Program to streamline how commissions are calculated.

Users holding BNB on Binance enjoy perks like trading fee discounts, token airdrops, and more. Our goal has always been to increase the utility of BNB, and we are happy to see our community benefit from these rewards.

As part of a broader update to the Affiliate Program, the Binance Referral Program is moving to a performance-based commission structure. This approach is designed to be fairer and more transparent, making Affiliate benefits accessible to a wider range of users and encouraging active engagement.

Key Changes

Starting 2025-09-09 00:00 (UTC), Binance will discontinue the referral commission rates that were based on holding BNB balances. This means that commission rates will no longer be adjusted based on your daily BNB account balance.

Please note:

If you currently hold 500 BNB or more and receive higher commission rates (40% on spot trading and 20% on futures trading), these rates will be phased out starting 2025-09-09 00:00 (UTC). From 2025-09-09 00:00 (UTC), all commission rates will be adjusted based on the userâ€™s referral activity and performance.There may be discrepancies between this original content in English and any translated versions.
