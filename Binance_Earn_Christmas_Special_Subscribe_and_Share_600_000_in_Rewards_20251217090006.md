Notes:

*New Dual Investment users are defined as users who have not subscribed to Dual Investment and Dual Investment RFQ products before 2025-12-17 00:00 (UTC).APR Rewards = Eligible Subscription Amount * 30% Boosted APR * (Duration / 365)The 30% APR Boost applies to subscriptions of $10 to $2,000 equivalent, with a duration of 1 to 7 days. Users who make subscriptions of more than $2,000 equivalent will only receive APR boost on their first $2,000 worth of subscription volume.For example, if user A invests 2,000 USDC in the instruments with subscription APR of 10% and a duration of 7 days, the boosted reward will be: 2,000 USDC * 30% * (7/365) = 11.5 USDC and the base reward will be 2,000 USDC * 10% * (7/365) = 3.8 USDC.
