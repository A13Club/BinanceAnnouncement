The quizzes are set up to ensure users are aware of the risks before trading tokens with the Monitoring Tag or Seed Tag. Users may find the Monitoring Tags and Seed Tags on the corresponding Binance Spot and Binance Margin trading pages, as well as on the Markets Overview page. A risk warning banner will also be displayed for all tokens with the Monitoring Tags and Seed Tags.

Binance will conduct periodic project reviews and decide if the Monitoring Tag and Seed Tag should be added to or removed from tokens as per its latest findings. These criteria are considered during the review:
