Fellow Binancians,

Binance has recently announced the delisting of Kadena (KDA) from the platform and informed users to withdraw KDA tokens. 

In line with our commitment to allow users to withdraw their KDA tokens after KDA delisting, Binance will continue to support the Kadena (KDA) community-maintained chain until 2026-01-12 03:00 (UTC). 

KDA withdrawals will continue to operate as normal. Please note that all future withdrawals will be processed on the community-maintained chain.

For more information, please refer to the announcement from the project team.
