# Binance Launches VIP Loyalty Program

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

As part of our ongoing commitment to provide users with the most value and competitive services, Binance will be introducing the VIP Loyalty Program. This program aims to offer our most dedicated VIPs exclusive opportunities to retain and enjoy their VIP status over time. 

How to Obtain the VIP Loyalty Tier:

The VIP Loyalty Program is exclusively available to users in the VIP Trader Program.Users who have achieved VIP 5 or higher via the VIP Trader Program and have maintained this status for at least 150 days within the past 180 days will be granted the loyalty tier.Once established, the loyalty tier will serve as a protected VIP level for the user.The VIP level of eligible users will be updated automatically on a daily basis. Users whose VIP level is equal to or higher than 5 can view their Loyalty Program status by visiting [My VIP] in the Binance App. The program will take effect from 2025-09-17.

Benefits:

The system conducts a daily VIP level review for loyalty rewards.If a user’s actual VIP level drops below their loyalty tier, and they hold a sufficient BNB balance required to maintain the loyalty tier, the user’s account will retain the loyalty tier instead of being downgraded.If a user’s actual VIP level rises above their loyalty tier, their account will be upgraded to the higher level automatically.For example, a user obtained VIP 6 from the Trader VIP Program and has maintained it for more than 150 days (does not need to be consecutive days) over the past 180 days: 

If the user’s trading volume drops below the required volume for VIP 6, but their Binance account holds 1,750 BNB (the required holding for VIP 6), they will retain their VIP level at VIP 6.If the user’s trading volume in any VIP Program and BNB holdings reached the requirement of VIP 7 or higher, the higher VIP level will apply. 

This ensures stable VIP benefits and privileges for consistent and loyal traders.

Note:

All VIP tiers mentioned above are based on the user's performance in the VIP Trader Program.All VIP tiers obtained by special upgrades, vouchers, or campaign rewards are not considered in this program.
