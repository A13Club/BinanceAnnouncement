# Binance Announces The Together Initiative - An Industry Recovery and Confidence Rebuilding Plan

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Over the last few days, the global crypto market has experienced significant volatility, impacting users, institutions, and the entire industry. To many, the aftermath of the macroeconomic downturn has been painful for our nascent industry, impacting not only asset prices but also user confidence.

Binance has also faced challenges. And we have faced scrutiny from both within and outside the industry. As the industry leader, we expect some level of scrutiny, fair or unfair. However, users are always our first priority. That is what makes us who we are. Without our users' support, there would be no Binance. 

While we continue to work through the specific compensation plan as previously announced, we have developed the following additional support for our users and the industry to navigate this challenging time together. Today, Binance has officially launched the "Together Initiative.”

I. $300 Million Token Vouchers

Binance will distribute token vouchers between $4 and $6,000, totaling $300 million to eligible users who meet all of the criteria below:

Users who incurred forced liquidation losses across Futures and Margin trading from 2025-10-10 00:00 to 2025-10-11 23:59 (UTC)Total liquidation loss amount: At least $50 equivalentTotal liquidation losses represent at least 30% of the user’s overall net assets based on the snapshot taken at 2025-10-09 23:59 (UTC) 

Binance aims to commence distributing the token vouchers in 24 hours, and targets to complete the distribution to eligible users’ Rewards Hub within 96 hours. Please look out for app and email notifications. Due to the heavy workload, there may be delays during the distribution process. We appreciate your understanding and patience.

II. $100 Million Institutional Support Program

For ecosystem and institutional users severely impacted by this market fluctuation, Binance will establish a $100 million low-interest loan fund to help them restart their trading. We expect this to inject momentum into ecosystem participants' recovery, alleviate liquidity pressures, and maintain stable operations for ecosystem partners. Eligible VIP and institutional users can submit applications through their dedicated account managers. We will provide a fast response and maintain strict confidentiality.

Final Words

During this challenging period for the industry, we understand that any decision will likely face dissenting opinions. To be clear, while we do not accept liability for users’ losses - we are doing this because we believe it is critical to rebuild industry confidence. Ultimately, Binance chose to invest these resources where they are most needed: with our users. This stems from our belief in the long-term development of the industry and our commitment to Binance’s User Focus values.

As with other challenging periods in crypto’s short history, we will get through this together, as one industry. We remain confident in our industry’s future. Finally, we would like to remind our community and users again that the crypto market is volatile and investment risks are inherent. Please invest rationally, manage your positions appropriately, and exercise due diligence.

Thank you for your support!

Binance Team
