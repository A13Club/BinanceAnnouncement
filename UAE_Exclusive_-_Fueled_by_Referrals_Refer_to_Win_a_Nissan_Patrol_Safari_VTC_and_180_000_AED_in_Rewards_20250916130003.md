This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance is drifting through the desert with a referral challenge like no other. From 2025-09-16 to 2025-11-16, bring your friends to Binance, fuel the prize pools, and drive home the grand prize: a Nissan Patrol Safari VTC.

Participants can earn from a total prize pool of 180,000 AED in USDT token vouchers. Referrers can earn up to 35 AED in USDT for contributing to the KYC referral pool, with the total referrer pool capped at 90,000 AED. Additionally, new users referred during the campaign who complete a first trade of $100 or more will be eligible to receive 70 AED in USDT, with the referee pool capped at 90,000 AED.

To make things even more exciting, every first-trade referral also grants the referrer an entry into a draw to win a Nissan Patrol Safari VTC. There is no limit to how many raffle entries a user can earn — the more friends you refer who trade, the higher your chances of winning.

Activity Period: 2025-09-16 12:00 (UTC) to 2025-11-16 23:59 (UTC)
