Reward Calculation Example:If an affiliate's benchmark volume is $28,000,000 , they are eligible for the “$25,000,001 - $50,000,000 ” tier. To earn the 500 USDC bonus, they must:

Increase their referrals' Futures trading volume by at least 25% (i.e., $28,000,000 * 25% = $7,000,000).The affiliate’s referrals achieved a total Futures trading volume of at least $33,000,000 during the Promotion Period. The affiliate's new total volume would be $28,000,000 + $7,000,000 = $35,000,000, which meets the criteria.

Qualified affiliates will receive USDC rewards, which will be distributed directly to their Spot Accounts within 14 working days after the Promotion ends.
