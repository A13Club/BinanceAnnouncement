Assets in sub-accounts are not eligible for the additional 1% APR Boost. For example, if the cap is $1,000,000 and the total combined value is $1,001,000 on 2026-02-06, the reward will be calculated based on $1,000,000.

Users will receive the 30-day rewards in USDC in the Spot Account of their master accounts before 2026-03-27 23:59 (UTC).Rewards will be distributed in USDC. BNSOL and WBETH rewards will be calculated based on the daily closing price. BFUSD and RWUSD rewards are calculated at a 1:1 ratio to USDC. If Binance detects any suspicious activity involving the selling of BNSOL or WBETH on the Spot market solely to obtain the additional 1% APR Boost, the VIP will not be eligible for the boost.USDC Interest-Free Cross Margin Borrowing:Interest-free margin borrowing is available exclusively for new USDC Cross Margin debt.Users can borrow USDC interest free up to the limit of their restored VIP levels, with the restored VIP level caps set out in the table above, with the actual rebate amount determined by the user’s actual interest expenses and at all times subject to the capped rebate amount for the corresponding restored VIP level and for the interest paid by the user during the 30 day period.For the interest-free margin borrowing limit, users must pay the chargeable interest amount for the USDC Cross Margin borrowing and then after the 30 day period, Binance will reimburse the interest paid by the user for this period, up to the restored VIP level cap amount.
