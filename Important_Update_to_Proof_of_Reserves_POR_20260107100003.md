# Important Update to Proof of Reserves (POR)

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, while ensuring account assets are always fully backed on a 1:1 basis, Binance is updating how our Proof of Reserves (PoR) is presented across individual assets.

What Is the Change

This update involves adjusting the scope of net account balances included under the Proof of Reserves. It aims to more accurately reflect all account balances on Binance. 

Previously, the net account balances did not include the platform’s own assets resulting in the display of inflated reserve ratio. This update will provide a more accurate representation of all Binance account balances, avoid confusion and help users better understand the essence of being 1:1 fully backed in Proof of Reserves.

We are always working to improve and optimize how we present our Proof of Reserves information. Since Proof of Reserves is unique to the digital asset industry and a relatively new approach to verifying assets, this updated approach reflects feedback from users, partners, and industry experts.

This update does not affect the safety, availability, or withdrawal capabilities of account assets. Account assets on Binance are always fully backed and can be verified on-chain at any time.

How Can Users Verify that Their Assets are Fully Backed 1:1

That is exactly what PoR is designed to prove. We use a Merkle Tree system that lets users independently verify their account assets on the platform. More information on the Merkle tree and how to verify your account assets can be found on our PoR landing page.

We remain committed to transparency and continuously improving our standards to keep your funds SAFU. Thank you for your continued trust and support.
