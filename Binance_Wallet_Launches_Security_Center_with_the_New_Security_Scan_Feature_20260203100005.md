This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

Fellow Binancians,

Binance Wallet is excited to introduce Security Center, a new security hub designed to help users identify and manage potential risks to better protect their assets. At the core of Security Center is Security Scan, a newly launched feature that automatically scans your wallet to identify potential security issues and provides actionable recommendations to protect your account.

Security Center also brings together existing security tools, including backup, verification method, approvals, Secure Auto Sign and more into a single, streamlined experience. This makes it easier for users to monitor risks and improve their wallet security in one place.

About the Security Scan Feature

Security Scan automatically scans users’ wallets to detect potential security risks across wallet setup, assets, approvals, and transactions. It supports both Binance Keyless Wallets as well as imported seed phrase and private key wallets, users can conveniently review and secure their different wallets within a single platform.

Detected issues are categorized by risk severity. Users quickly understand whether their wallet has no issues, medium-risk issues, or high-risk issues, and prioritize actions accordingly. 

Security Scan checks for the following types of risks:  

Wallet Security: Monitors your wallet’s backup status and operating environment, helping you strengthen backup practices and reduce risks, such as unauthorized access, abnormal permissions, or potential wallet compromise.Asset Security: Analyzes tokens and other assets in your wallet or watchlist to flag assets that may carry elevated risk.Approval Security: Reviews active wallet approvals to identify dangerous, excessive, or unnecessary permissions, and enables you to revoke them easily.Transaction Security: Examines transaction history and on-chain interactions to detect potential threats, helping you avoid sending assets to risky or fraudulent addresses.

Receive Actionable Alerts

Whenever the Security Scan identifies potential risks, users will receive an immediate alert on the homepage along with clear, actionable recommendations.

For example, if your wallet approval list contains an unrecognized token or a risky permission, the Security Center will promptly detect and highlight it on the home page. You will be notified with a clear risk alert and guided on the next steps, such as revoking the approval with a single tap.

Additionally, automated scans continuously monitor your wallet to proactively identify potential threats, ensuring your security without requiring any manual effort.
