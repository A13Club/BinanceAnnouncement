# Introducing the BuildKey TGE Model on Binance Wallet in Collaboration with Aspecta

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region. Terms and conditions apply.

Fellow Binancians, 

Binance Wallet is excited to introduce a new Exclusive TGE model in collaboration with Aspecta, powered by the BuildKey mechanism.

Unlike traditional Token Generation Events (TGEs), this model first distributes allocations to users through BuildKeys. A BuildKey is a credential participants receive by depositing BNB via Aspecta, representing a certain token allocation. These BuildKeys can then be traded in a bonding-curve liquidity pool before the official token launch, and later redeemed for project tokens at TGE.

The first project to launch with this TGE model will be announced on the official Binance Wallet X account on 2025-09-18. 

Aspecta BuildKey TGE Mechanism Overview

Phase 0: Preparation

View project info and connect your Binance Wallet (Keyless).Check Binance Alpha Points eligibility to participate.

Phase 1: Deposit and Receive BuildKeys 

Deposit BNB on Aspecta via the Exclusive TGE page on Binance Wallet to receive BuildKeys, which represents your allocation.Allocation follows an oversubscription model and is distributed equally if oversubscribed.Participation consumes Binance Alpha Points and is limited to eligible Binance Wallet users. Successful deposit secures a guaranteed token share.

Phase 2: BuildKey Trading 

After the deposit phase ends, users can trade BuildKeys in the bonding curve liquidity pool. Simultaneously, an additional allocation of BuildKeys is released by the project, subject to a hard cap. Binance Alpha Points are required to access trading but will not be consumed.Users can buy or sell BuildKeys during this phase. Trading limits per wallet apply separately and do not include BuildKeys obtained in the deposit phase.If BuildKeys are available in the pool, buy orders can be executed immediately.If the pool reaches its hard cap, new buy orders can only be filled when other users sell their BuildKeys back into the pool.

Phase 3: TGE & Redemption 

Once the TGE begins, BuildKeys can be redeemed for project tokens.Alternatively, users may sell BuildKeys back into the pool at the current price.After liquidity is added, the redeemed project tokens become transferable and tradable on Binance Alpha.

Benefits of the the Aspecta BuildKey TGE Model

Early Liquidity: BuildKeys can be traded during the BuildKey Trading phrase, allowing participants to access liquidity before the official token launch.Open Participation: When some participants sell their BuildKeys, new buyers can join the event and secure allocations throughout the BuildKey Trading period.Transparent Pricing: Prices follow a predefined bonding curve that adjusts with demand, ensuring fair and predictable allocation for everyone.More Flexibility: After TGE, BuildKeys can be redeemed for tokens at any time, or sold back into the pool while liquidity remains.

Notes:

A BuildKey is a credential participants receive by depositing BNB. It represents their token allocation and can be traded in the TGE pool or redeemed for project tokens at TGE. It is not transferable outside the TGE system.Phase 1: Deposit & Allocation The initial deposit phase (allocation via BuildKeys) is at a fixed price, similar to a traditional TGE.Allocation follows a standard subscription model and is distributed equally if oversubscribed.Phase 2: BuildKey TradingBuildKeys can be traded in a bonding-curve liquidity pool before the official token launch.Prices in the liquidity pool are dynamic and may vary with demand. Early buyers may get lower prices; later buyers may pay more.The final price of tokens redeemed may differ from users' initial expectations due to trading in the bonding-curve pool.Users should understand and accept the risks involved with TGE and Bonding-Curve based TGE trading before participating.
